When I work with https://github.com/eclipse-vertx/vert.x/pull/4401 and do some research and test, I found problem when I create JsonObject and JsonArray with `ImmutableCollections`.

Take  the below example:

```
  @Test
  void testMapOf(Vertx vertx, VertxTestContext testContext) {
    Map<String, Object> map = Map.of(""x"", 1);
    JsonObject obj = new JsonObject(map);
    logger.info(""Run testMapOf with JsonObject "" + obj);

    try {
      obj.put(""y"", ""222"");
      testContext.failNow(""Should not reach here"");
      return;
    } catch (Throwable t) {
      logger.info(""Run testMapOf with JsonObject updating error"" + t);
    }

    testContext.completeNow();
  }
```

When I create JsonObject with a map created by Map.of, a immutable map, the JsonObject instance I created cannot updated again, this feels strange.

This pull request is a draft and look forward to further discussion for a correct solution if this is a problem, and I will make a reasonable change after that.
If this is expected, I will close it.",liuchong,236058

```java
Future<Void> f = returnSomeVoidFuture();

The problem here is that when the unary `Function` argument is invoked, `unused` has the value `null`, so programmers must be careful not to reference it. To mitigate this danger, I have been using a naming convention for such unused parameters, but I think a better solution is to allow passing a nullary `Supplier` function instead:

```java
f.compose(() -> returnAnotherFuture());
```

This changeset adds support for that syntax, and similarly for `Future::eventually` (which has the same problem).

P.S. I think it would be nice if `Future::onComplete` and `Future::onSuccess` also supported this syntax, but that change seems much more difficult to implement in a backwards-compatible way.",markmatney,6744471

### Issue
Fixes: https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/issues/13312

### Description
In the beginning, I thought the problem had to do with the layout, but it turns out it's more about threads.

To make the layout hierarchy better, I tried taking out `LinearLayout` from `onboarding_megaphone.xml`. Unfortunately, this change didn't fix the issue.

After digging deeper, I found that the `onConfigurationChanged` method inside `ConversationListFragment` was incorrectly calling `onMegaphoneChanged` directly. It should go through `lifecycleDisposable`.

I tried to emit the current `megaphone` object using the following approach, but it didn't work because of the use of `distinctUntilChanged`():
```
fun onConfigurationChanged() {
    store.update { it.copy(megaphone = megaphone) }
}
```

Instead, I fetched the next `megaphone` object from the `repository` and updated the state.
```
fun onConfigurationChanged() {
    megaphoneRepository.getNextMegaphone { next ->
        store.update { it.copy(megaphone = next ?: Megaphone.NONE) }
    }
}
```

Final solution: 
Moved `onConfigurationChanged` handling from `ConversationListFragment` to the `ViewModel`, ensuring consistency in UI updates via `lifecycleDisposable` and maintaining the guarantee of UI observations on the main thread.

Before, `activeCount` was used to know whether a new fetch was enqueued while the messages were being retrieved. But if somehow, a first fetch is being idle or the count is not correctly decreased, the service is not properly stopped. Previous fetches should be ignored when one succeed.

Previous behavior (activeCount) may result in :
- the ""Checking for messages..."" notification lasts for a long time (maybe part of #12904)
- Increased battery drain (useless foreground service)

This is part of the log I've seen when the foreground service's notification was lasting

When an emoji only message is sent as spoiler in a conversation, because of transparent background and spoiler color being that of text(white) spoiler animation is invisible. To solve this we would have to check if background of bodyBubble background is transparent, if yes based on system theme set the text colors so that spoiler animation can be visible. Spoiler animation color will be that of the text color. PFA the illustration.

### Description
When text is entered in group stories chat with a spoiler, the content gets displayed as Empty because in EmojiTextView we are not allowing spoilers to be rendered. To solve that we need to add ""app:emoji_renderSpoilers=""true"". Now after displaying the spoiler, on click we need the text to be revealed. This needs to be done using SpoilerAnnotation.SpoilerClickableSpan class. We create a new clickablespan class which will override onclick method which will call spoiler.onclick which reveals the text.

When entering a URL of certain pages into the message edit field, the link preview text would use an incorrect charset and become unreadable.

This occurs when the page has the charset (which is not UTF-8) declared only in the HTML head, while the charset in the HTTP response is not explicitly declared.

See signalapp#13050 for an example.

This fix, instead of immediately defaulting to UTF-8 if an explicit charset was not declared in the HTTP response, looks for a charset declaration in the HTML.

Clicking on a `SwitchView` toggles the state of the view but the state is decided by the `model.onClick()` function called in the `onCheckedChangedListener()`. Therefore changing the `onCheckedChangedListener()` to `onClickListener()` since it does not make sense to wait till the state is changed to trigger `model.onClick()` and also updating the toggle state explicitly so it is updated only one the `model.onClick()` changes the state.

### Description

Notification delivery is a bit wonky if data saver is on, as this causes the network to be blocked in the background any time the app is not running a foreground service. 

The overall problem here is that the foreground service stops too early, before the delivery receipt makes it out. Then, if more messages come in, FCM will buffer and delay the alerts for them because it just woke the app up right before, and it looks like the app is still running. 

The behavior right now is that if I send two consecutive messages to a device in Data Saver mode, only the first one will make it through. The second one will be delayed for some arbitrary amount of time. Also, if I send a message to a device in Data Saver right after the app is backgrounded, the message will be delayed. 

This is a small incremental change that saves the app from continuing to wait on a WebSocket that is already dead. This resolves some of the delays around messages that arrive right after the app is foregrounded.",g1a55er,132613020

While working on https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/pull/12921 and other changes, I was often getting frustrated that my editor's settings weren't matching the existing file, or that my editor would make other changes, like adding a trailing newline.

This PR:
- adds indentation settings to the existing `.editorconfig` to match the styles for existing `*.kt`, `*.java`, and `*.gradle` files
- adds `end_of_line = lf` to `.editorconfig`, and updates the few Windows-newline using files to match
- adds `insert_final_newline = true` to `.editorconfig`, and updates the (many) text files without trailing newlines to match",LukeShu,90273

There are 3 unrelated bugfixes here, each as a separate commit with more details in the commit message.

But the ""why this is worth merging"" for each is:
 - Get `docker run --rm -v $PWD:/project -w /project signal-android ./gradlew qa` to pass (since it doesn't right now; even though it passes in GitHub actions and directly on my laptop)
 - Get `./gradlew test` to pass (since one of the tests is broken right now)
 - Fix an MMS-related crash (but this is probably low-priority, since MMS support is going away).

### Description
Through my changes and additions, I aimed to make the ReadMe file more friendly towards beginner developers who want to contribute to the Signal Android Repository. There is a wiki with a lot of detailed information regarding the documentation but it was a bit difficult to understand how to navigate regarding installation as well as contributing code. I added a Table of Contents in the Readme so each part is easily accessible. I also added information regarding the compatibility of Signal Android with the Android OS. In the Contributing Code section, I added information regarding how to go about contributing to the open source, highlighting the steps as well as providing a helpful link for beginners. In that section, I also highlighted useful testing methods and provided a helpful link to go along with it. I added some encouraging words in Contributing Ideas. In the installation section, I created a set of steps that are the most beneficial for beginners and put a link to the build area of the wiki. I added my thoughts on Android Studio and why it would be the best platform for beginners working on Signal Android. I hope through the changes, more beginners will contribute to Signal Android and become more proficient in developing software!

### Description

This PR is a draft that has the goal of adding Links as ""collected"" media that can be viewed at the MediaOverview.
As suggested in the [forum](https://community.signalusers.org/t/allow-mediaoverviewactivity-to-display-links/49498/6) i am opening a draft pr here to track the progress and discuss the ui if nessessary.

At the moment it only contains prototypes that do not have actual functions. The link-tab only mirrors the audio-tab one until i can figure out how i can add links to the MediaDatabase. Help is appreciated in that regard!

As suggested by the code style guideline, i DO log, and therefore leak, sensitive data. So this PR is by no means safe or ready to use. It will be removed once i progress on implementing the database.",newhinton,25279821

fixes https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/issues/12549

If a user has an image set, then the view showing their picture is itself a button that allows you to view the image at a larger size.

If a user does not have an image set, then the view is still a button but the button won't do anything...

After this change, bringing Talkback focus to the user's profile image will read ""view contact photo"" (even if there is no contact photo to view). I did try to see if I could disambiguate whether there was something to be viewed or not, but that proved a bit beyond my time + skills right now, so hopefully it's more helpful than harmful to have the view labelled this way.

Hello,
A while back, I opened a Signal Community thread regarding a very simple feature I was able to code myself:
https://community.signalusers.org/t/show-file-size-before-downloading/177

I was hoping to catch the eye of a moderator or developer who would be able to verify this with the powers-that-be and perhaps just take the commits (with any necessary edits) for merging into the Signal Android codebase.
It seems some folks liked this, but that was it.

This would be my first open source contribution, but on encouragement from another user, I am opening a PR. The community post mentions how I tested the feature. I would be very happy if the feature makes it in even without any of my code.

Thanks!",parapetual,42040738

Fixes #12323
Transparent dark color should be grey, not black.
I also suggest to make all transparent color variables the same way. It is harder to see during ""light"" mode, but light transparent colors are also wrong(they represent white color, but light UI background color is not white). 
Here you can see a result of my change.

Inactive toolbar:
![Transparent grey inactive](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20519507/187960132-02ca0f24-b460-4ab1-9723-5658bd4b02d5.png)

As you can see, that color matches the color of UI, despite it is transparent.

### Description

Removed `pin_disable_reminders_dialog` and the associated translations that are no longer used.

There is no point in verifying the ""PIN"" to disable ""PIN"" reminders. It would only make sense to do this if one were required to type in the ""PIN"" to disable the registration lock, disable the ""PIN"", and change the ""PIN"". But it is not required in any of those places.

It was said by Moxie if you didn't want a ""PIN"", then create a long random ""PIN"" and throw it away. So some people don't know their ""PIN"" by choice and guidance from Signal. Also if you are like me your ""PIN"" is an 80+ bit key and saved in a password manager and/or written down. Which means I won't lose my ""PIN"", but it's annoying to type.",Sc00bz,2030592

This change adds a new dialog as part of the new group flow between the user selection and the group naming. The dialog only shows if there exists groups locally that match the added members. The dialog also allows the user to continue to create a new group.

The inspiration behind this is I often forget the name I set for old groups and occasionally create new groups when I would have preferred to find the old group.

But when you want to change your backup folder, currently you have to turn backups off and on again. There is no other way to choose a different folder. This comes with the downside that you also get a new passphrase. This Pull Request makes the displayed folder name clickable so you can choose another backup folder. Not moving or removing the current backup can be seen as a feature, the user keeps the copy of the backup (probably on another storage device). The user can move or remove the old backup files manually.",Roghetti,398796

### Description
Link preview can have images and those images can be pending download depending on the media settings. Images and movies cannot be forwarded before they are downloaded but forwarding button is available on the toolbar if you select a link preview whose image is not downloaded yet. But forwarding ultimately fails if the image was not available yet, making the behavior looks confusing to users.

The solution implemented in this PR is to set hasPendingMedia for link previews so that actions that should not be available would not become available.

The bug was [reported in the beta forum by Blue42](https://community.signalusers.org/t/beta-feedback-for-the-upcoming-android-5-27-release/38993/202).

### Description
When I, a Japanese want to set my profile name in Japanese characters, we use an input method editors. The current implementation in Signal has a bug in the `given name` field that doesn't allow me to input correct Japanese characters because every `afterTextChanged` event _commits_ the alphabet when it is still in the middle of entering a single character. See the screen record if it doesn't make sense for those non-ime users. I believe this bug also affects Chinese and Korean users, and maybe others too.

The solution implemented in this PR is to check if the input mode is already set as expected and leave it intact if it is.

#### Steps to reproduce the bug
0. Have a Signal Android in an Android phone whose setting allows you to input Japanese characters using Qwerty keyboard.
1. Launch Signal
2. Go to Settings
3. Tap your name
4. Tap your name again to see the profile name editor
5. Tap on your first/given name
6. Enter some Japanese characters. Hiragana, Katakana or Kanji using Qwerty keyboard.

### Screen recordings

In both videos I was entering Japanese characters in _last/family name_ field first, which is working as expected, and then moved on to _given/family name` field which has the bug, in Signal Settings -> [Tap on my name] -> [Tap on my name] -> name editor view.

Protoc update to 3.18.0 mainly fix M1 compilation #11878, but also windows compilation #11871

**Note** I haven't touched the runtime versions.

See https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/8062

I just went forward to the oldest version of protoc that supports M1, see [this comment](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/8062#issuecomment-953284983) which looking at [maven](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/google/protobuf/protoc/3.18.0/) it seems to be correct that's the earliest.

Also, there were two versions of protoc before, now just one.

### Description
Related Issue : https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/issues/11759

Method `org.thoughtcrime.securesms.util.SaveAttachmentTask#saveAttachmentìs` responsible for saving attachment but returns a useless string. This string will always be ""media"".That's why the message shown to the user is ""Saved to media"".

Instead of returning a value that won't be used later or will be used but without added value, I refactored the method to return a string that can be used to identify the path of a saved attachment(contentType:fileName).

The returned value from `org.thoughtcrime.securesms.util.SaveAttachmentTask#saveAttachment` will be used then by a helper method that will identify the output path based on contentType and fileName using the android.os.Environment constants

The message looks like below :

`VersionTracker.updateLastSeenVersion` is the only place in the codebase that sets the last version code in SharedPreferences. However, on the initial run of the app, the preference won't be set. This results in the `TextSecurePreferences.getLastVersionCode` using the current version as the default value.

But this results in the `VersionTracker` code skipping the if-statement block, so it doesn't set the last version code in the SharedPreferences. What results is that we never have a value for the last version code, so `TextSecurePreferences.getLastVersionCode` always defaults to the current version code, and thus we always skip the if-statement in `VersionTracker.updateLastSeenVersion`. 

Side effects of this bug: 
* Feature flags are not refreshed immediately after updating to a newer version
* Local metrics may not be cleared after updating

This PR attempts to fix the problem of the date field in a voice message being truncated when the toggle speed widget is shown.
Tested this PR by sending a voice message, waited until the date for the message was shown in the format ""HH:mm"", played the voice message, observed that the date field was no longer truncated.

But in the app's build.gradle we can define the URL for the recaptcha which is than generated in the builds config, but unused here. So it will be nice to really use the defined parameter from that config. Otherwise the definition in build.gradle is useless and can be removed there. I think using the BuildConfig would be the better solution.

### Description
The current Android behavior is that threads without messages are removed/hidden from the default and archived thread lists.
They can still be found in the NewConversationActivity, but the behavior is confusing for users and also inconsistent with the other apps, e.g. Signal-Desktop doesn't delete a thread if all its messages are deleted.
The user can already delete a conversation thread explicitly, so there's no need to automatically delete the conversation thread when its last message is deleted.

There are several reports about this unexpected behavior, and also in the Play Store comments:
https://community.signalusers.org/t/deleting-all-messages-in-a-chat-removes-it-from-the-list/25537
#8406
#10054
#10100
#10586
#11399


This PR prevents empty threads to be deleted/hidden and also prevents empty threads to be created when opening the ManageRecipientActivity of a new contact.
- Removed the `MESSAGE_COUNT != 0` checks from `ThreadDatabase`
- Adapted `ThreadDatabase` to not automatically delete empty threads
- Adapted `ManageRecipientRepository` to not create an empty thread if it doesn't exist yet

This PR is a minimal implementation of the feature,  if you're interested in it, I can clean it up further:
- Remove the now unused column MEANINGFUL_MESSAGES/message_count from the thread database
- Add a migration to delete threads without meaningful messages, that are currently hidden. So the user doesn't get overwhelmed with threads with people she never chatted with.",AsamK,2340865

Signal 5.10.x series introduced a new import of `com.google.android.gms.common.util.Hex` in `emoji/EmojiJasonParser.kt`, to use Google's proprietary hex-to-string conversion utility function.

This two-liner commit replaces it with Signal's internal `util.Hex` function. Thanks if you can merge into 5.11!",tw-hx,61621210

### Description

BatApps, https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.batapps.android, is an android app that creates a second user profile on the user's device and allows them to install hidden instances of other apps on that profile. If the user chooses to install a second contacts list, it would be useful for the Signal Messenger instance installed on the primary profile to hide (i.e not display) message threads that contain recipients who's phone numbers are saved in the second profile's contact list when the second profile is in the hidden state. When the profile is reactivated, all message threads should be visible again.

I have created a short video to demo the feature: https://youtu.be/XJAmEFbasxQ

It is important to note that on the Android system IPC across profiles is limited to activities. We added an invisible activity to Signal to allow BatApps to notify it when to update the ConversationsListFragment.

BatApps also provides the user configurable options for when to hide the profile, for example every time the device's screen is turned off or after a certain time since they last activated the profile. The basics are described in this video: https://youtu.be/GqTq8GHORUo

I would be happy to discuss any feedback you may have or the possibility of future integrations. Feel free to reach out accordingly!

### Description

It adds a new option to block messages from unknown senders. This option is useful for users who keep in touch only with a set of known contacts, and don't want to receive any messages from someone else. It's a sort of allow-list for security, anti-spam, or just convenience for small teams or communities. Many users have requested this feature in the forum.

The incoming messages from unknown senders are just ignored when this option is enabled, following the same rules as if the recipient was already blocked by the user. An ""unknown sender"" is a recipient that it's not present in the system contacts, or the user doesn't share their profile with.

I also added two more commits to fix some inconsistencies in the blocked-users preference UI. The goal is to make the fragment more like the rest of the preferences of the app (colors, font size, ripple, and padding).

To take multiples pictures one after the other, the current flow involve:
1. Take picture
2. click ""+""
3. click up-right camera icon

This flow is tedious because 1) there are three steps although 2 should be enough, and 2) the step 3. is using a camera button which is diagonally opposed to the capture button and thus really hard to reach with one hand
This feature was suggested here:
https://community.signalusers.org/t/ui-improvement-for-adding-multiple-camera-pictures/9200/8

before this PR, 2. and 3. look like that:

Increased the size of the profile picture because it was way too small to see, even with decent eyesight.

The profile picture on the ""manage profile"" page is way too small to see well. That, along with the empty space on the page makes it seem odd that it's so small. This pull request simply changes the size to make it easier to see and readjusts the size and position of the camera icon to fit as well.

In testing, I first visually inspected the pictures to make sure they were in alignment correctly, then I tried different device rotations and did another visual inspection along with checking different device sizes, lastly, I clicked all over the picture to ensure that the click registered at the correct positions.

### Description
This change adds an option to restrict calls from using mobile data. My wife
experienced a video call using 750 MB of data even though she was on WiFI. It
needs to be controllable in case you are on a metered plan since it might
otherwise make the call very expensive. My wife almost uninstalled Signal
because of this, but I got her to stay by promising I would fix it.

This change depends on my changes made to RingRTC (see https://github.com/signalapp/ringrtc/pull/26). You need to make sure you have the right version of RingRTC. This fixes #8529

----------

### Description
There is a fairly obvious NullPointerException bug in RegistrationNavigationActivity.newIntentForNewRegistration(). There is a null check for `intent` after it has been constructed with the `new` operator ... that is obviously non-null, while the `@Nullable originalIntent` is ignored in the null check.

Testing:

1. I've added a unit test that demonstrates the NullPointerException.

    Without the fix, the unit test gives:

    ```
    java.lang.NullPointerException

The goal is to make a color of a navigation bar the same as the Light Theme of the app. The current problem is that the color of the navigation bar is pure black when there is light theme enabled. However, if user switches to dark theme, the color changes too. This pull request fixes the issue by adding `<item name=""android:navigationBarColor"">@color/white</item>` to theme.xml in values-v23 folder. The change applies to registration screen, main screen, chats, contact list screen and settings.

### Description
This allow to have the image taken from the camera with the right orientation even though the auto-rotate is turned off, that is the phone is locked to portrait or landscape mode. This is the behavor WhatsApp has. 

To do so, we add a listener like illustrated in the link below which updates the target orientation constantly.
https://developer.android.com/training/camerax/configuration#java

For example, here is a picture taken with auto-rotate off with the user holding the phone in landscape.

This is not a perfect solution, make image compression slightly less worse than without it.

Recently the maximum image width was reduced from 4096 pixels to 1600 pixels, the same number WhatsApp uses for years. 1600 isn't the most logical number. In this PR I used standard video formats as baseline, which most smartphone displays also use.

The maximum of 2160 is both the vertical resolution of a regular 4K-screen (3840x2160), but also the vertical resolution of a 18:9 1080p display (1080x2160). So it's high enough to share 1080p screenshots, even in the 18:9 ratio.

Another advantage that for pictures in the 3:2 aspect ratio 2160 is perfectly dividable: 2160/3*2 = 1440 pixels on the short side, while 1600 pixels tries to reduce it to 1066.67 pixels, mostly rounded to 1067.

The max resolution is a little higher and so will the file-size be, but that's were the fall-backs are for. These are also adjusted to common screen and video format resolutions.

------

Talking about fall-backs: Currently the encoder tries (as far as I understand it) to drop resolution when the maximum file size is exceeded. I don't think this would be the best way, I would suggest dropping the quality parameter in the encoder. By default JPEG quality 70 now is used, instead of dropping resolution dropping encoder quality to 60 or 50 should first be tried.

### Description
The attachment keyboard covers all area of the landscape screen of smaller screen smartphones so that it becomes impossible to enter a message in the input area. The cause was because the height was not re-calculated when the available screen height changed.

The fix is to respond to Android's onMeasure call and measure the height every time the layout needs to be updated to properly occupy the area both in portrait and in landscape mode.

The bug was reported in the [beta forum](https://community.signalusers.org/t/beta-feedback-for-the-upcoming-android-5-3-release/25088/220)

### Description

This commit will make Signal scale large thumbnails generated for link previews to a size no larger than 512x512 pixels before saving or sending. 

Currently, when generating a link preview, Signal will load an image provided by a remote website and, if under a simple 2 MB file size limit, accept, recompress, store on local chat history and then send it to the receivers. These images can be much larger than actually required by the intended application, wasting storage and bandwidth. The problem is exacerbated when sending link previews to large groups due to amplification effects.

Limiting the size of these images is also important as they will accumulate on receiver's chat history and is not unrealistic to expect an user to collect a few thousand link previews on long lived chat sessions or, more commonly, on group chats. Deleting them from the media list, which a typical user may be tempted to do after seeing several large but apparently unused files there, will cause the original message to be deleted too, so this approach may not be always desired.

Taking the page https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Oxford_Tolkien.JPG as an example: current stable version (v5.3.12) generates a 1200x1800px thumbnail of 359 KB. With the changes proposed here, this thumbnail is scaled down to 341x512px, resulting in a JPEG file of only 38 KB and still with enough quality to be used in the preview.

The 512x512 px limit is mostly based on the current recommendation for stickers and seems acceptable for this context. It gives enough resolution for a good presentation, while a larger image won't necessarily give more information to the user. Opinions on this are welcome, of course.

### Description

If Screen Lock is enabled, the Rate me dialog will appear as soon as the screen is unlocked instead of the expected `RatingManager.DAYS_UNTIL_REPROMPT_THRESHOLD`.  With screen lock inactivity timeout set to its smallest alllowable number, and the user dismissing the Rate me dialog by tapping outside of the dialog, this could mean that the Rate me dialog is displayed  every minute.   
The dialog will also show up whenever the user taps on a contact from the home screen, views the conversation screen for that contact, and then returns back to home screen.

This PR fixes the above problem by preventing the Rate Me dialog from being dismissed when tapping outside of the dialog.  By doing so, the user is forced to select one of the Rate me dialog buttons.

This fix was tested by actually attempting to dismiss the Rate me dialog by tapping outside of the dialog.

### Description

This commit allows the user to send a message by pressing Ctrl+Enter on a physical keyboard.

Sending messages using only a physical keyboard is a relevant use case for accessibility (people who can't or have difficulties touching the screen) or UX (faster typing), but currently Signal does not _really_ allow this. The alternative of enabling option ""Enter key sends"" has the side effect of preventing the user from entering line breaks in the message. It is also possible to use tab-cycling as a workaround, but it is not very practical for now (see [#2](#2-sending-messages-and-tab-cycling)).

While Android apps don't have an universal standard for this use case (see [#1](#1-behavior-of-other-messaging-and-related-apps)), Ctrl+Enter seems to be the best approach because:

- It does not break any existing behavior (even undocumented ones) or user expectations;
- Allows the user to have both behaviors and can be overridden by ""Enter to send"" option if the user wants;
- Same keybinding used by Telegram, Gmail and possibly others;
- Does not require new settings;
- Does not seem to have any negative impact on a11y;
- Among the options, it seems to have the lowest impact on code (a single line changed, seriously);
- No perceivable impact on performance;
- No new requirements for API levels (`KeyEvent.isCtrlPressed()`is stable since API Level 11, Android 3).


Of course, comments are welcome. 





----------


### Footnotes

#### 1. Behavior of other messaging and related apps

For reference, follow the behaviors I tested in a few other communication apps (all on Android). 

- Telegram: Enter adds a new line, Ctrl+Enter sends the message. Tab changes focus to the message history, so user the scroll through them with the keyboard, but focus never reaches the send button.
- Gmail:  Enter adds a new line, Ctrl+Enter sends the email.
- Android 7 SMS app (ver 2.1.163): Enter adds a new line, Ctrl+Enter and Shift+Enter does nothing. Tab sends focus to ""Add MMS media"", a second Tab to the emoji button, focus never reaches the send button.
- Android 9 SMS app (ver 5.0.052): Enter adds a new line, Ctrl+Enter and Shift+Enter does nothing. Tab sends focus to ""Add Contact"", a second tab puts the focus on send button; Pressing Enter with the send button in focus sends the SMS and put focus back to input line automatically.
- Skype: Enter sends the message, Ctrl+Enter adds a new line.
- Google Meet: Enter always adds a new line (Ctrl+Enter does nothing). Send by keyboard requires a tab to focus in the send button, after that the user needs to tab-cycle through to all other controls to get back to the input line.
- Jitsi Meet: Enter always sends the message, Ctrl+Enter does nothing. Tab puts the send button on focus, once user presses Enter the message is sent and focus is lost (the only way to put the focus on the input line again is touching the screen).
- Mattermost: Both Enter and Ctrl+Enter sends the message. Shift+Enter adds a newline.


#### 2. Sending messages and tab cycling

On Signal 5.3.12, pressing tab from the input line will put a invisible focus in the send button so user can send the message with Enter after that. However, focus does not return to the input line automatically and user needs to tab-cycle through all other controls to get it back there, and not all controls give feedback on their focus. An advanced user may notice that after the Enter to send the message, focus will fall (invisibly) in the return button and pressing it will back to the chat list with the most recently used one pre-selected, and pressing Enter again will open this chat with the input line in focus. There is a bit of timing for this as the end button takes a few milliseconds to give focus up and, so, two immediate Enters will cause the second one to try to send an empty message, so user must stay aware to this. However, ""Type message → Tab → Enter → Enter → Enter"" is still the fastest keyboard-only way to write and get ready to answer (but a bit awkward). Restoring focus to input line after sending from the keyboard may be a nice improvement, but that's a thing for another PR.

### Steps to reproduce the issue
1. Prepare a group chat that does not have its own profile picture
2. Open Signal, go to the chat
3. In the toolbar menu, select ""Add to homescreen""
4. Confirm that the dialog pops up
5. Cancel the dialog.
6. Open the Android's system ""recent apps"" by tapping on the square button of the Android's system navigation bar
7. In the list of recent apps, select Signal again

**Expected behavior**:

Signal opens the chat and nothing else happens

**Actual behavior**:

Signal opens the chat and the ""Add to homescreen"" dialog pops up again

### Description of the issue
Glide's task automatically resumes upon `onStart` or `onResume` of the activity when the last state was an error. It is an error for Signal to be unable to load a profile picture from a URL so `onLoadFailed` callback is called in the steps above.

Opening the recent apps list puts the activity to paused state and selecting Signal again resumes the activity and it is when Glide kicks in and resumes the task that *failed* the last time.

The solution is to clear Glide's target when either of the callback was called so Glide won't resume requests again on onStart/onResume.

### Motivation
I raised this [issue on the community forum](https://community.signalusers.org/t/privacy-issue-notifications-for-disappearing-messages-shouldnt-show-content-or-name-regardless-of-the-receivers-notification-settings/1868) three years ago. At that time, my intention was incorrectly interpreted. Later, there were more reports ([one](https://community.signalusers.org/t/privacy-issue-notifications-for-disappearing-messages-shouldnt-show-content-or-name-regardless-of-the-receivers-notification-settings/1868/8?u=agfngr), [two](https://community.signalusers.org/t/dont-show-disappearing-message-contents-in-the-conversation-list/6238), [three](https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/issues/5781)) on this issue and finally I was able to convey my true intentions for this feature, simply put by [Meteor0id](https://community.signalusers.org/t/privacy-issue-notifications-for-disappearing-messages-shouldnt-show-content-or-name-regardless-of-the-receivers-notification-settings/1868/15?u=agfngr):

> _It is currently valentines day. Say I send my girlfriend, who is at work, a sexy message. I want to send the message in such a way that she doesn’t accidentally open it while her coworkers are sitting next to her in a meeting. And the notification should not automatically display on her lock screen as soon as the message is received._
>
> _A disappearing message should never show content of the message nor the name of the sender on its notification, regardless of the notification setting of the receiver._

I am aware of the fact that disappearing messages are [only intended to keep a tidy history](https://signal.org/blog/disappearing-messages/), but this feature would be so much more powerful and much more in line with a users expectation if the content isn't revealed in the notifications nor the conversation list. Especially these days where there's so much inflow of users coming from other applications. After all these years, I still think it's confusing that you set up a conversation where messages expire after a specific amount of time, which happens at the senders side, but the message is readable for an undefined amount of time in the notifications of the receiver or as a preview in the conversation list...

### Description

This PR moves the ""Invite friends"" button to the top of the contact list.

Reasoning:
- streamline it with what iOS has
- give it more visibility. Because really, nobody scrolls down 100+ contacts. So previously, only when searching for someone you would come across the button.

This pull request does a small design change to the new wallpaper feature.
The input bar background is made transparent such that the wallpaper can be seen.
The background of the attachment keyboard is changed to have rounded corners at the top.

### Description
The previous implementation of the search function matched only single quotes among the special characters by replacing them with a single space. However the same can be done for other special characters as well. This PR addresses the same and additionally only displays the relevant result for a query made. For instance, if there are two messages test'com and test&com, searching for test'com returns both the texts whereas, with this PR, only test'com is returned.

I use video and voice calls alot, and that picture-in-picture was annoying, there's no need to show pip on voice calls, so i disabled the pip mode in the Android configurations, but i came across the bug that when i tried to close the call screen nothing happened, i had to use the home button. So i decide to fix it, now the code only enter in pip mode if the video call is enabled, and the user can leave the call screen if pip is disabled in the Android settings.",williamspacefire,4999076

This PR fixes a sorting issue with contacts retrieved from the on-device SQLite database. Contact sorting via ORDER BY was previously not requesting case-insensitive sorting, so contacts with lowercase names were appearing at the end of the contact list rather than collated with other contacts starting with the same letter in uppercase.

This fix was tested by first reproducing the issue on a Pixel 2XL running Android 11, changing the order by clause, and then re-installing Signal and refreshing contacts to confirm that a contact with a lowercase name was located with other contacts beginning with the same letter in uppercase rather than at the end of the contacts list",ChewTeaYeah,4544658

This pull request resolves the change that issue [#10149](https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/issues/10149) reported. The issue was prevalent in any chat conversations when one user would receive an attachment from another user, save it, and not know the location of the saved file. 

Before any changes, as stated in the reported issue ([#10149](https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/issues/10149)), the pop-up text that is created when a file is saved only states ""File saved in media"", but not the actual path, causing the file to **not be able to be found afterwards**. With the changes I have made, instead of vaguely stating ""media"", I made it so that the pop-up text will provide the **specific path the downloaded file is located** (as requested in [#10149](https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/issues/10149)). Below is a screenshot:

### Description
As is discussed correctly [here](https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/issues/10076#issuecomment-708886589) the current trimToFit implementation uses `substring` method which does not take surrogate pairs and grapheme clusters into account, so that results in a broken unicode character when it is trimmed.

This PR rewrites `trimToFit` method to take unicode characters of a surrogate pair and a grapheme cluster in mind.

### Description
One issue I have with Signal is that when you clean up room when deleting large media files or link previews, it also deletes the
associated message which you might want to keep. This option makes Signal only delete the media, not the message text.

When the option is switched on:

and you have these media messages:

1. Fixes the font size on the action bar of both media picker fragment and contact picker fragment to follow the modern theme applied elsewhere.
1. Sets the navigation bar color and style, the status bar and style, and also removes full screen flag when contact picker fragment appears. This fragment follows the user's selected theme (light or dark) unlike other fragments in MediaSendActivity which forces dark theme. The navigation bar and the status bar appear dark even if the user chooses light theme.

### Description
In the beta feedback 4.61 https://community.signalusers.org/t/beta-feedback-for-the-upcoming-android-4-61-release/14547/95  some issues with the value for the keyduration were posted. It seems that on all/a part of Android 6 devices the keyduration for AAC audio files is always 0.

This commit is a possible fallback to get the duration of the AAC on another way.
I couldn't test this on an Android 6 device, but simulated with both test devices (see above) the calculated keyduration was equal with the normal keyduration (MediaFormat.KEY_DURATION).

For safety reasons, three tests were added at the beginning of the new method ""getKeyDurationFallbackForAAC(extractor)"".
If the expected values are incorrect, 0 is returned as the duration.

To calculate to duration the methods MediaExtractor.seekTo(...) and MediaExtractor.advance() [minimal use, see https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/pull/9766] is used.
seekTo(...) is used for fast forwarding in 10sec, 1sec, 100ms and 10ms steps, if still necessary then advance() is used.

### Description
On some devices, especially my device, it takes a long time to generate the AudioWaveForm/AudioHash of a voice message.
A voice message of 30 minutes has taken ~112sec on stock Signal, ~160sec with self-built Signal.
The cause was the frequent iterative use of extractor.advance(), which seems to be no problem with other devices.
Instead of extractor.advance() to go through each frame, seekTo(...) is used to go directly to the desired frame whose values are to be used for the audio hash.
Two further values were used for this: BAR_FACTOR and barTimer.
BAR_FACTOR contains the time difference between the desired frames.
barTimer contains the time of the actual frame.

In addition, the newer type 
ByteBuffer inputBuffer = codec.getInputBuffer(inputBufferId);
ByteBuffer outputBuffer = codec.getOutputBuffer(outputBufferId);

is used instead of the deprecated processing with buffer arrays
ByteBuffer[] inputBuffers = codec.getInputBuffers();
ByteBuffer[] outputBuffers = codec.getOutputBuffers();

The time for generation is now ~3sec for a 30 minutes voice message with 99%/100% the same values for the AudioHash.

further note:
seekTo() does not seem to recognize whether the entered time goes beyond the stream.
Therefore, when using it, make sure that the entered time remains below the duration of the audio message.

### Description
This PR fixes a bunch of places where currently system emoji are displayed (without the ""Use system emoji"" preference set):
- Conversations search box
- Messages search box
- Profile editing fragment
- Contact and profile names in received messages
- Contacts list when creating a new message/group
- Contact chips when creating a new group
- Contact filter box when creating a new message/group
- ""Contact Us"" help box
- Names in the conversation list
- Conversation search empty state message
- Names inside conversation updates

In most cases this was just a case of changing `TextView`s to `EmojiTextView`s and `EditText`s to `EmojiEditText`s, but I also added an emoji implementation of `SearchView` and modified `ContactChip` to support emoji.

One area that is not yet fixed is the automatically generated letter-based avatar images that can be seen in the conversations list. If for example a contact's second name is just an emoji, the emoji will be rendered in system style in the avatar.",freddytuxworth,6254628

When sharing a location the location description is added as text. The user can add an additional text that is currently appended to the location description.
With this change the user message comes first and the location description is appended, which makes the message easier to read. It also allows to display the user text as preview in the conversation list instead of just a difficult to understand part of the location description.

### Description
The crash of #9417 was caused by the safeguard added in [this commit](https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/commit/02865f99a9b8e84611c9d8db7ee31bff2ceceb63).
When verifying the account, the uuid is not set yet and this causes the app to crash when it tries to generate a notification for the received SMS, thus I disabled notifications for received SMS messages when we are are still verifying. Registering the account sets the uuid, but this requires the SMS to be received. Receiving this registration SMS was previously done in the `RegistrationNavigationActivity` using an `SmsRetriever` filtering on the `SMS_RETRIEVED_ACTION`. However, when Signal already is the default SMS app, I noticed that the `SmsRetriever` did not trigger, but that a `SmsReceiveJob` was registered. Thus, I factored out the functionality for processing a registration SMS, made the `SmsRetriever` use it and made the `SmsReceiveJob` use the function when it receives an SMS while registering.

I followed the steps to reproduce #9417 and verified that the app did not crash, registered and was able to exchange messages with other users. I then uninstalled the app, and registered as usual (with Signal not being the default SMS app). Now, I did receive the registration SMS, but the code was not filled in automatically. However, the auto-fill seems to only work when installing from the Playstore, so I'm not sure if the refactoring the `SmsReceiveJob` to handle registration SMS messages was neccesary.

----------

### Description
Feature request this pull request solves: [Rate-limiting Notifications](
https://community.signalusers.org/t/rate-limiting-notifications-aka-delayed-batch-receive-periodically-muted/1761/8)

The main idea was to decrease spamming of notifications when a very active chat is going on. After reading the code I realized that this is already implemented, but the limit being set to two seconds. Increasing the limit to 30 seconds feels right. You will get notifications after there has been more than 30 seconds without any messages being sent, so you still ""feel"" the action of the chat. However, you avoid your phone constantly notifying and vibrating.

#### Testing
I have personally used the signal app with this fix for a couple of weeks, and I am a lot more satisfied with using the app.

Also the following test has been performed.
1. Send a message
2. Verify notification received
3. Send multiple messages shortly after the first one
4. Verify no notification received
5. Wait 30 seconds
6. Send a message
7. Verify notification received",frikksol,13680486

Fixes #9445
When forwarding an audio message and attaching a long text, the text may become wider than the voice message (which takes up a hard-coded 210dp). The footer, in this case, aligned with the right side of the audio player, instead of with the right side of the message bubble. By making the contents of the footer have their `gravity` set to `end`, the footer always ends up in the bottom right corner of the message bubble, independent of the message length.

### Description
As Described in #9220, there are memory leaks in the ConversationActivity. This PR aims to solve the ones that happen when opening and closing the activity. The AsyncTasks created in the initializeSecurity() and saveDraft() methods have implicit references to the activity. By moving the code of these AsyncTasks to separate classes and making weak references to the activity, these references are not created and the memory can be liberated. As seen in the memory profiling below, when the app is put in background, memory can be freed up.

Contacts using Facebook, Instagram and other platforms always share links containing tracking parameters such as **fbclid** and **igshid**. This PR is about automatically removing said trackers when Signal receives text to share.

Since the development ideology of the project warns about implementing user-facing features, this PR includes 2 commits. The first one with the links cleaning feature always activated. And the second one adding a user-facing switch (in *Settings > Privacy*) to control this feature.

I tested it with both commits, by sharing:
- A link containing trackers only
- A link not containing trackers
- A link containing trackers and useful parameters
- A long text with several links containing trackers and useful parameters
- Image(s)

**Note:** it removes the following trackers: `utm_*`, `ocid`, `fbclid` and `igshid`.

### Description

`checksum-dependency-plugin` is a superset of `gradle-witness`, and it enables to increase the level of security.

Key features:
* Gradle plugins can be verified (grade-witness doesn't track plugins)
* All Gradle configurations are supported (e.g. `java-library` plugin is supported). `checksum-dependency-plugin` intercepts detached configurations as well (e.g. the ones that are created on demand)
* PGP can be used for verification. PGP can be used with or without checksum. PGP enables to detect and prevent issues like https://blog.autsoft.hu/a-confusing-dependency/

Even though CONTRIBUTING.md says `PGP is our guide for what not to do`, I still think PGP for dependency verification is an improvement over existing gradle-witness, and it does not really introduce PGP to the app itself.

Note: I have not removed `gradle-witness` yet, however this PR makes `gradle-witness` obsolete.",vlsi,213894

The height of the status bar in PassphrasePromptActivity was set to a
hard-coded value that was too small for both notchless and notched
phones. This caused the toolbar to clip into the status bar. This PR 
fixes the issue by replacing the transparent nav and status bars with
opaque fixed ones. This has the added benefit of a more attractively
colored status bar.

If the transparency was set so that the nav bar matches the theme better, then the nav bar color can be changed manually to a white variant (as of API 27). 

This change has been tested on both light and dark themes.

Fixes #8653

### Description
Removing the Sonar Ping sound has left some users unhappy, because they can no longer hear an audible difference between the connecting phase and the ringing phase. @geyson-signal argued that the sound was not necessary, but did make the call seem longer which could be a negative experience (https://community.signalusers.org/t/beta-feedback-for-the-upcoming-android-4-33-release/5880/23?u=meteor0id) . From reactions in the following days it became apparent some kind of distinct sound is actually preferred by some users, and I think that especially the visually impaired would greatly benefit from this difference, since they might not be able to reply on the textual difference on their call screen. As a solution, in this PR I propose to revert the changes made when removing sonar ping, but instead of the sonar ping sound use a sound which is much closer to the ringing sound itself. The idea is that anyone who doesn't care to hear the difference won't, but someone who pays attention to it can clearly hear it. The new connecting sound is identical to the ringing sound with the sole exeption being that the connecting sound is slightly shorter than the ringing sound (and thus also loops a bit faster).

I have also taken the opportunity to preform some noise reduction on the ringing and busy sounds. I have done this using audacity. I have take great care to preserve the old and authentic sound of the ringing sounds, while reducing the static, and making the quiet actually quiet. The timing of the tracks has also been perfected, to assure the looping is seamless from now on.

This is an ongoing PR to review and enhance the language used by Signal.

Some of the text strings were open to misinterpretation. In this PR we add missing [signal words](https://www.google.com/search?q=signal+words). Another major improvement is that some descriptions are more informative, allowing users to fully understand why there is a toggle switch, and what they are choosing between. Finally, consistency across strings has been reviewed, which also has a positive effect on translations.

Descriptions on in-app preferences should always assume the user has no pre-acquired knowledge or context.

This PR does not change the names (the keys) of the strings, because that would put extra workload on the translators. By not changing these the strings are treated by transifex as altered strings rather than new strings and the translation history remains available to help accelerate translation.

A few new strings have been added, but none have been removed. This PR needs more work, it does not yet touch the code where the new text strings are implemented. Feel free to assist in making the new strings useful.

There is no Github issue for this PR. This PR is addressing issues which have been discovered by the translators on Transifex. They are found in individual comments on text strings.

Commits are not in perfect logical chunks because a lot of minor changes were made over time, but the PR can easily be reviewed by looking at the file changes.

### Description
This is a small set of updates a group of friends and I have had issues with using the Signal App. A few are bugs, but most of the changes are quality of life changes to Group Messages (MMS). Mainly in how to create new ones and re-opening up pre-existing ones. Below is a list of the changes made:

1. Fixed bug when making a new MMS group it would not add you to the group (creating 2 MMS groups when someone responded)
2. Updated MMS groups to have an editable group name & avatar
3. Added new text to tell the user if a group message is an MMS message
4. Added a ""Create Group Message"" button to the home screen. To activate long press the floating ""New Message"" button (looks like a pencil) on the main page and it will pop up. Additionally you can long press and swipe up in the same motion to make a new Group Message. (the option to make a group message in the menu (ellipses button) still exists)
5. Update Group Message screen to auto fill Avatar & Group Name with existing avatar and group name if the group already exists.
6. Updated to the latest version of Signal 4.32.6",drohack,14166824

#### The problem
On devices with a top notch, the toolbar in the `PassphrasePromptActivity` is partially obscured. (See images below.)

#### The solution
Add new method `adjustForNotch(Toolbar toolbar)` which adjusts the top margin of the toolbar according to the top system window inset. This is performed by using `ViewCompat.setOnApplyWindowInsetsListener` to listen for the window insets, and then setting the  top margin on the toolbar's `MarginLayoutParams`.

It has been tested with the dark theme on one device (Pocophone) in addition to light themes on all devices, and some screenshots using the light theme are shown below.

Fixes issue where the tick (on green background) displaying successful authentication reverts to fingerprint icon (on blue background) in the instant before proceeding to allow access to the app. See gif files below for demonstration.

#### Why this occurs
In `PassphrasePromptActivity`, the `FingerprintListener` controls the UI when fingerprints are accepted or rejected. 
* When fingerprint is rejected, the appropriate animation finishes by returning the icon to its default state (expecting a fingerprint). This is desired.
* When fingerprint is accepted, the icon is also returned to its default state after the animation. _This is not desired, because the app is not expecting a fingerprint (and because the sudden change is jarring for the user)._ 

### My solution
Remove the code resetting the icon to its previous appearance at the end of its animation in `onAuthenticationSucceeded`. This does not affect the animations and UI changes in `onAuthenticationFailed`.

An instance of `FingerprintListener` is only read in one line of the codebase, so I expect no unintended side-effects.

### Description
According to the Activity documentation (https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity):

> Keep in mind that onResume is not the best indicator that your activity is visible to the user; a system window such as the keyguard may be in front. Use onWindowFocusChanged(boolean) to know for certain that your activity is visible to the user (for example, to resume a game). 

Indeed, for example in a locked phone with an open conversation, when a phonecall is received and ends and while still in the lockscreen, onResume() is called marking the conversation as read.

For the read receipts therefore, the sending of which effects all recipients of a conversation it is sensible to use onWindowFocusChanged() to ensure the window is focused.",rkourdis,24491404

Fixes #8480.

The [Unicode Technical Standard 51](https://unicode.org/reports/tr51/) that defines Unicode emojis defines certain codepoints to be by default to be displayed as emoji and other to be displayed by default as text. One can always override this default by appending the `U+FE0F VARIATION SELECTOR-16` (for emoji) or `U+FE0E VARIATION SELECTOR-15` (text) codepoints after the emoji. The emoji selector screen handles these correctly. The iOS app also natively handles these correctly.

This PR adds this functionality into Signal Android. In particular, it stops certain unicode characters such as the trademark sign (™) from being displayed as text characters that makes them prettier and nicer to copy, in contrast to being displayed as a emoji with a different colour as previously. See #8480 and signalapp/Signal-Desktop#2969 for more details.

This is implemented as follows: the unicode emojis that are specifically to not be represented as emojis by default are in a `HashSet`. When the `emojiTree` is constructed, those emojis that end in `U+FE0F` and aren't in this set have an extra emoji added to the `emojiTree` without the `U+FE0F`. Code that previously replaced any unicode emoji with the emoji representation is removed.

Let me know what else needs to be done to merge this!",aapeliv,2975660

This automatically marks contacts as verified when the fingerprint successfully matches, similar to the behaviour on iOS. This helps ensure that it'll always actually be ticked if verified, so I don't have to forever wonder if I _really_ didn't verify that contact, or that I just forgot to tick the box, which risks lulling me into a false sense of safety in the former case.",edef1c,50854

This patch enables Signal for Android to run decently on Chromebooks.

*  Because most (all?) Chromebooks do not have mobile service, they cannot receive SMS directly.  Therefore, you will probably have to verify your phone number by entering the confirmation code sent to your phone.  This is similar to running on an Android tablet.

*  Signal currently allows only *1* Android device per phone number. See [here](   https://support.signal.org/hc/en-us/articles/360007320451-Troubleshooting-multiple-devices
).  So if you already use Signal on your phone, you will have to use another number (such as a Google Voice number available with your Google account) to set up Signal on Chromebook.

*  On the bright side, you get audio + video calls on your Chromebook!

*  Windows are re-sizable and the top window is not destroyed by escaping or hitting back (You can hit ^W to close it, however).  You also get multiple windows in newer development versions of ChromeOS, which is kind of cool.  File transfers, GIFS, and other basic features work well.

*  Chromebooks and QWERTY-keyboard devices enable the ""Enter sends"" preference by default, so that hitting the keyboard ENTER/RETURN will send the message (rather than add a linefeed).

*  If you run into build issues, look at Issue #8329 for a solution.  This currently builds successfully for me on Android 3.4 canary in Linux(though I'm sure it will build on older versions) with the easy #8329 fix that may not be needed on those older Android Studios.

NOTE:  Without this commit, there is currently no acceptable upgrade path for most current Chromebook owners. Although some CBs can run the standalone Desktop version via a ""Crostini"" Linux container, this is neither as lightweight nor as [available](https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/08/22/google-confirms-many-older-chromebooks-wont-get-linux-apps-including-2015-chromebook-pixel/) as an Android solution.  (In the future, the Android client should be able to be run on the same account with the user's phone. But that's another commit altogether...)

### Description
This change was made based on this IDE recommendation:

The WIFI_SERVICE must be looked up on the Application context or memory will leak on devices < Android N. Try changing context to context.getApplicationContext()

On versions prior to Android N (24), initializing the WifiManager via Context#getSystemService can cause a memory leak if the context is not the application context.  In many cases, it's not obvious from the code where the Context is coming from (e.g. it might be a parameter to a method, or a field initialized from various method calls). It's possible that the context being passed in is the application context, but to be on the safe side, you should consider changing context.getSystemService(...) to context.getApplicationContext().getSystemService(...).

### Description
Replace nullable instances of getActivity() with requireActivity(), getContext() with requireContext(), and getFragmentManager() with requireFragmentManager(), which are methods since 27.1.0 in the Fragment class that do null checks on the activity or context or fragment manager and throw an IllegalStateException if it's null, instead of letting the app crash with a NullPointerException. 

https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/support-library/revisions#27-1-0

In this PR I only make changes in four scenarios:

1. The IDE gives a warning ""Argument getActivity() might be null"" or similar for the other methods
2. The IDE gives a warning ""Method invocation ..... may produce NullPointerException""
3. getActivity().getString() is called from a fragment. In this case it can be changed to just getString(), which internally calls getResources(), which calls requireActivity()
4. getActivity().getResources() or getContext().getResources() is called, as in #3, can be changed to just getResources()

Fixes #8273

Changes the launchMode for the main activity to `standard` instead of `singleTask`. Previously it was launched with `singleTask`, which caused the app to clear the back stack down to the ConversationListActivity, closing whatever conversation the user had been looking at the last time the app was open. This occurs when a user reopens the app through the android launcher, which triggers the `MAIN` intent.

With this change, the app will resume to whatever Activity the user had open prior to switching apps or pressing the home button. If the app is actually closed, it will of course reopen to the `ConversationListActivity` as expected",jpinsonault,137581

Adds an additional option to themes allowing the app to pick light/dark theme based on what the system is using.

Testing was done by trying different combinations of system and app theme to make sure that the correct theme was being chosen and that the new option wasn't interfering with the original options.

### Description

> When there is an unread message of e.g. contact A in my messages and I get a new message from contact B in the meantime, the notification for the message of contact A is shown (including the time I received it).
I enabled the setting where only the contact name, not the message is shown in the notification (if this is important, idk).

Issue boils down to code block being executed for API above 23 calling single thread notification followed by also calling multiple thread notification that is called regardless of API version. This fix will signal only once depending on the API version ensuring the right notification is displayed to the user.",brian-mcnamara,22810320

### Description
It is possible when setting message indicators that a failed message will have an associated `NetworkFailure` object which has been set to null. If the failed message is a push group message and the NetworkFailure object is null, the eventual call to `getAddress()` during message send retry will throw a `NullPointerException`. This method call on a null NetworkFailure object is what caused the crash referenced in #7413. Instead of trying to get an address off of a null NetworkFailure, this change will set the address to null which will result in a failed send instead of an application crash.

This change was tested by forcing a null NetworkFailure to be created (hard-coded) during a retry of a group message. I first was able to re-create the crash, and then verify that the new changes averted the crash. I then tested that this change preserved normal functionality for an expected NetworkFailure by directing Signal to a bad server URL, forcing the retry button, and then retrying under normal network conditions for both individual and group messages.

### Description
Currently text messages are silently cut when they are longer than 2000 characters (as mentioned in issue #5146). It can be really annoying as users may not even notice that part of message is not shown if the message is not cut half-sentence. I had this problem multiple times when my contact copied a longer text to me using Signal Desktop and I tried to read it on Android.

Resolving the issue properly probably requires a lot of work (like adding a way to display full message body or splitting large messages into smaller parts) and I believe it will take some time, especially considering that the issue mentioned is already over a year old. In the meantime I think it would be fair to inform users that part of message is not displayed so that they can resolve it with their contacts somehow (like using another communication channel or splitting the message manually).

The search function finds convos from both the inbox and the archive, leading to some problems with (un)archiving. This PR contains two commits:

**Fix swipe-to-(un)archive in search mode**

- Draw the unarchive icon and perform the unarchive action when archived convos are swiped to the right
- Animate the list item back to its intial state after the swipe is completed. Otherwise it gets stuck in the swiped position like this:

**Fix batch (un)archiving in search mode**

- Show ""archive"" action button when only unarchived convos are selected
- Show ""unarchive"" action button when only archived convos are selected
- Otherwise, show no button

### Description

Fixes #4906, in collaboration with @FeuRenard

This adds a ""share"" button to the MediaPreviewActivity. Some details:

- This appends a file name with mimetype-specific extension to the PartProvider URI format (required by certain apps)
- I wasn't sure if we want to offer ""share"" functionality for drafts at all, but ended up implementing it. The additional PersistentBlobProvider-related logic went into PartProvider, though - not really sure if this is appropriate. Alternatively, to turn PersistentBlobProvider into its own ContentProvider, we'd need to change the way it's instantiated (currently there's no public constructor). Would love some opinion / guidance on this!

Tested with images / videos / GIFs attached to messages plus all sorts of drafts from:

- builtin camera
- intent camera (this fails if the target app can't resolve file:// URIs, i.e. when it doesn't have the storage permission)
- attachment drawer -> Image / Video / GIF / ""recent photos"" thumbnails
- stuff shared to Signal from the Android gallery",haffenloher,264472

### Description

I applied the same listener as in `ConversationItem` with 68bf5f3 for the body of converation update items. This allows you to reliably select linkified conversation updates with a long click - independent of the spot you tap on.
16e56ec removes the links for conversation updates as soon as you are in selecting mode. This prevents clicking and following a link while selecting conversation items.

As a result the conversation update items behave exactly the same as regular conversation items when you attempt to select them.

### Description

This PR improves **inactive group** and **blocked contact** conversation views:
* merge `initializeEnabledCheck()` and `setBlockedUserState()` into new `updateConversationState()`
* hide ""disappearing messages"" menu item
* hide call button
* hide ""reset secure session""
* hide ""invite"" menu item
* hide compose panel in inactive groups
* rearrange menu items so that the first five and the last item are consistent for single and group conversations.

I found that [MessageRecipientListItem.java#L185](https://github.com/WhisperSystems/TextSecure/blob/f1e8357131a91c9000bebcd0b8858a2be7c4adb5/src/org/thoughtcrime/securesms/MessageRecipientListItem.java#L185) never gets executed because for group messages, `record.recipients` only contains a recipient with `name` and `number` being ""Unknown"".

With the proposed change (basically the same as [SmsDatabase.java#L434](https://github.com/WhisperSystems/TextSecure/blob/f1e8357131a91c9000bebcd0b8858a2be7c4adb5/src/org/thoughtcrime/securesms/database/SmsDatabase.java#L434), just without the call to PhoneNumberUtils.formatNumber()), `record.recipients` contains a recipient with `name = ""Some Group Name""` and `number = ""__textsecure_group__!some_group_id""`.
The resend button now only resends to the selected recipient.

I'm not sure if there's some existing code relying on the current behaviour. At least I found no problems when testing sending, re-sending and receiving one-to-one and group messages with and without media.

Continuing the work in #1248, this PR is the place to discuss whether, when, and how we want to move releasing from Travis to CircleCI.

_openzipkin/zipkin on CircleCI_: https://circleci.com/gh/openzipkin/zipkin

Why: https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1237
## Things to consider before merging
- Do we like the trade-off CircleCI makes in terms of build executors? OSS orgs (NOT repos) get a total of 4 containers, meaning we can do 4 things at the same time. At the moment `openzipkin/zipkin` is configured to use all 4 containers for running tests in parallel, but over time we may want to have concurrent builds of separate commits / branches. PRs also run on the same pool of containers, as well as any other `openzipkin` projects we may migrate to CircleCI in the future. OTOH we can pay monies for more containers, unlike with Travis (citation needed).
- Do we want to spend extra effort on doing a test-run of the deployment process on ""non-production"" Bintray / Maven repos?
- Are we really comfortable jumping onto CircleCI? Maybe run a dual setup for a while and learn by doing.
## Things to do before merging
- Review! ;)
- Add credentials to CircleCI, in one of two ways:
  - Via the web UI: https://circleci.com/docs/environment-variables/#setting-environment-variables-for-all-commands-without-adding-them-to-git
  - Encrypted in `circle.yml`, tooling more rudimentary than in Travis: https://github.com/circleci/encrypted-files
- Disable builds on Travis to avoid confusion when they both want to upload to Bintray
- Enable ""GitHub Status updates"" on https://circleci.com/gh/openzipkin/zipkin/edit#advanced-settings
- Replace build badge in `README.md` (https://circleci.com/gh/openzipkin/zipkin/edit#badges)

## Steps to reproduce

I reset the parameter values in the ParameterIntercepts Plugin.

`statementHandler.getParameterHandler().setParameters((PreparedStatement) invocation.getArgs()[0]);`

However the parameter logging included both the old and new parameter values, which is the issue.

        accountMapper.insertCredential(account);
        accountMapper.insertPaymentMethod(account);
    }
    // ...
}
```

If you use this `Executor`, it create only three `Statement` of JDBC batch updating.
If you use the traditional `BatchExecutor`(`ExecutorType.BATCH`), it create many `Statement`( 3 statements * account list size).

What do you think this new `Executor` ?

## Description

We detect some memory leaks due to the ViewTarget being leaking the target view. If glide is called without a context, this ViewTarget is never cancelled and bad things happens. This is a change to prevent that to happen.
## Motivation and Context

Due to a bad use of the library or because of architecture restrictions, you may be calling Glide with a ViewTarget but without any activity or fragment context, so your view could be leaked and with it, the fragment and the activity that contains it. With this change, making ViewTarget to handle the view as a WeakReference, prevent it from doing any kind of leak, no matter how the library is used.

### Fix #10034 AggregationQueryEsDAO sortMetrics NullPointerException for instanceScalarApdex metrics when logical shard is disabled
- [ ] Add a unit test to verify that the fix works.
- [ ] The column name to retrieve the aggregation value was hardcoded to `value`. However, when logical sharding is disabled some metrics uses other column names to store their values..

Additional debug info:
```
Metrics Name service_instance_sla terms bucket {key=redacted, doc_count=15, percentage={value=0.0}}
valueColumnName percentage
valueColumnName value null
Metrics Name service_instance_apdex terms bucket {key=redacted, doc_count=15, value={value=null}}
valueColumnName value
valueColumnName value null
```
`valueColumnName value null` this causes the NullPointerException.

If the clients of AGENT deploy on kubernetes and call the OAP service by default cluster IP mode without any technology of service mesh like istio etc. it will occur the issue about traffic load. So for we have resolved this issue via the headless service difination without the clust IP setting and registered multiple A records of DNS for the OAP service on that. Anyway it needs to enhance the code of this class for the defualt behavior of load balance and almost has not any impact if it is out of kubernetes environment. Seems to work smoothly

There're many users asking for support to ES7, #3047 #3187 #3000 #2529 , this PR tries to make the OAP backend work with ES7, without breaking the capabilities of ES6.

There're some breaking changes in ES7, since we are (and will) still using ES6-java-client, all the efforts are made by lower level REST client of ES.

In this PR, we don't use high level REST client to ES7, which is more convenient and is used in ES6 storage plugin, by using low level client, we can pass some parameters that ES6 doesn't support, such as `if_seq_no`, etc.

Some of the parameters are deprecated in ES7, but according to the upgrade strategy of ES, the deprecated parameters should work at least in all the minor versions under a major version, so there may be warnings in the log, but it does no harm, that's as was expected.

@wu-sheng Although the E2E tests passed (locally, and should be the same in Infra Jenkins), I'll propose to mark this as **Experimental** in the documentation for now, and invite some users to try and if the feedback is positive, we can make it **Stable** in the future version, documentations should be added later after fully discussed.

Anyone who wants to review this PR, please pay special attention to the ES6 storage plugin, this PR should not break the ES6 plugin in any aspect, thanks.",kezhenxu94,15965696

the comment `// Recreate the new list to avoid change list while the list is used in consuming.` reminds me of the `CopyOnWrite` data structure that is perfectly suitable to this scenario, although the method `addNewTarget` is not frequently invoked, I did a simple benchmark out of curiosity.

    return true when in asyncStop do invoke finished

目的是提供能力用来判断调用是否成功调用了fishished方法

原因如下：
  在调用了prepareForAsync后，而后如果是最后代码点调用asyncStop因目前asyncStop实现法中和stopSpan方法中pop last span逻辑而致没法触发fishished方法
如此时再调用stopSpan因asyncSpanCounter==0可以触发fishished方法
但如果调用asyncStop方法内已经触发fishished方法，而后直接再调用stopSpan则会再次触发fishished方法
同时也不能直接调用stopSpan(因之前调用prepareForAsync,asyncSpanCounter不为0且isRunningInAsyncMode=true,故没法触发fishished方法）
由于实际代码存在两种情况，需要调整API返回调后的结果以后判断

之后就这样调用：
```
if (!span.asyncFinish() ){
    ContextManager.stopSpan(span);
}
```

892336476,Replaced Castle DynamicProxy with PostSharp as an experimental fix for #5604,6144,3464095,aspnetboilerplate/aspnetboilerplate,['wontfix'],closed,2,2021-05-15T02:24:50Z,2021-08-28T15:50:43Z,2021-08-28T15:50:43Z,"### Description
I've replaced all Castle DynamicProxy interceptors with PostSharp Aspects to fix the issue #5604
All unit tests are passing.

### How to use
PostSharp requires its NuGet package to be referenced at ALL projects that has code that require aspects.
That means if your project implements new **AppServices**, **Repositories** or uses the `AbpAuthorize`, `Audited`, `RequiresFeature`, `UnitOfWork` or `UseCase` attributes, then you must add the PostSharp package reference for those features to work.

Also you must add a file named `postsharp.config` to the folder where yor *.sln* file is located, with the following content:
```XML
<?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""utf-8""?>
<Project xmlns=""http://schemas.postsharp.org/1.0/configuration"">
	<Multicast>
		<AuthorizationAspectProvider xmlns=""clr-namespace:Abp.Authorization;assembly:Abp"" />
		<AuditingAspectProvider xmlns=""clr-namespace:Abp.Auditing;assembly:Abp"" />
		<EntityHistoryAspectProvider xmlns=""clr-namespace:Abp.EntityHistory;assembly:Abp"" />
		<UnitOfWorkAspectProvider xmlns=""clr-namespace:Abp.Domain.Uow;assembly:Abp"" />
		<ValidationAspectProvider xmlns=""clr-namespace:Abp.Runtime.Validation.Interception;assembly:Abp"" />
	</Multicast>
</Project>
```
This file tells the PostSharp MSBuild targets to add the interceptors to your code when the solution is compiled.

In order to get the best experience working with PostSharp, it's highly recommended to install the [PostSharp Visual Studio Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PostSharpTechnologies.PostSharp)

### How it works
While Castle DynamicProxy generates Method Interceptors at runtime by generating proxy classes when a new instance of the class is instantiated by the IoC container, 

PostSharp removes all that runtime overhead by *injecting* the interception code to all classes or method that have the aspect applied with an attribute, or with the aspect applied with an `IAspectProvider`.

As these aspects are applied at compilation time, it's not possible to dynamically add them at runtime, forcing you to have the PostSharp package at all packages that have code expected to have those aspects.

I've implemented both Aspect and IAspectProvider classes for the existing ABP interceptors.
Aspect Providers are classes that run when the project is being compiled and uses reflection to determine all classes and methods that need the aspect to be applied. If you find that some class or method is missing the aspect functionality, it's probable that some rule defined in the IAspectProvider is missing, or that the PostSharp package or configuration file are missing.

### Disclaimer
Event if all unit tests run successfuly, this code is not production ready and requires further testing and optimization.
I've yet to test if everything works fine in a final project that uses ABP to its full extent.

The original DynamicProxy interceptors have been completely removed from the code, to be completely sure that only the PostSharp aspects are being used and executing correctly.",emisand,2250102

317690554,[WIP] Add feature to track data changes from GetData<>,3307,3464095,aspnetboilerplate/aspnetboilerplate,"['feature', 'wontfix']",closed,3,2018-04-25T15:55:22Z,2019-11-29T06:46:40Z,2019-11-29T06:46:40Z,"**This pr is working in progress and it's not ready to merge.**

## Why send this pr
When we use `GetData<>` from `IExtendableObject`, we may forget to SetData when it changes. 
For example:
```csharp
var obj = entity.GetData<ComplexObj>(""MyObj"");
// ... some changes
obj.Value1 = ""A"";
// in the other place
entity.GetData<ComplexObj>(""MyObj"").Value1 // oops
```

It will be better if we have a _Trackable_ data, which has an association between the object and the entity. So that every changes to the object can change the entity too.

```csharp
var obj = entity.GetTrackableData<ComplexObj>(""MyObj"");
// ... some changes
obj.Value1 = ""A"";
// in the other place
entity.GetData<ComplexObj>(""MyObj"").Value1 // we got ""A""
```

## how do i implement it
I added a package [ChangeTracking](https://github.com/joelweiss/ChangeTracking), it use `Castle Dynamic Proxy` to create a dynamic proxy. So I added `GetTrackableData<>`, which returns a proxy with a hook on it. It will call SetData each time we modify the object. Currently, it doesn't support interface, array or dictionary. It only
supports POCO whose propertise are all virtual. But it does support
List, IList and ICollection. (See ChangeTracking's README for more information.) 

Pull request https://github.com/joelweiss/ChangeTracking/pull/25 adds IDictionary support, but it's not merged yet.

In the case where the string is already in cache, it now takes only 0.95ms.

It would be possible to make that even faster, and additionally to keep that page shared with other GLFW processes, by using `mmap()` instead, but for now I opted to not change the memory representation.

I also changed the mappings.h format to be a single `\n`-separated string instead of multiple different strings, so that we can call `glfwUpdateGamepadMappings()` once instead of once per entry, this alone was a ~2ms win.

I expected SwiftLintFile.match(pattern:with:range:) to return if any of the SyntaxKinds in the array I passed in were a match, but in the implementation its checking to see if the parameter has a match on every SyntaxKind passed in. It's like an AND instead of an OR?

SwiftLint determines the files to lint based on build output. Specifically, it peeks inside of a `.SwiftFileList` file:

```bash
export SWIFT_RESPONSE_FILE_PATH_normal_x86_64=""/Users/erik/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/Flagship-cxvakyfeadqmyecwvirxgmrbkpoa/Build/Intermediates.noindex/Flagship.build/Debug-iphonesimulator/Experiences - CartCheckout.build/Objects-normal/x86_64/CartCheckout.SwiftFileList""
```

These build output lines are split on spaces. If the line that contains the file list has a split - then the path itself will be split:

```
Debug-iphonesimulator/Experiences\ 
-\ 
CartCheckout.build/Objects-normal/x86_64/CartCheckout.SwiftFileList
```

No file list will be found, and no Swift files will be added to the list of files to lint.

### Fix

Adding onto the space-escaping pattern used in [CompilerArgumentsExtractor.swift ](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/blob/master/Source/swiftlint/Helpers/CompilerArgumentsExtractor.swift#L86), convert escaped spaces immediately into Unicode ""null"", allowing code that requires splitting on spaces to be able to rely simply on `components(separatedBy: "" "")`.

When needed, unescape these strings just-in-time.

As I saw in another pull request, I have filled out the *New rule request* info below.

# New rule request

> 1. Why should this rule be added? Share links to existing discussion about what the community thinks about this.

TODO and FIXME comments are prone to overuse. That made them very unpopular (e.g. [Todo Comments Considered Harmful](http://wiki.c2.com/?TodoCommentsConsideredHarmful), [The case against TODO](http://wordaligned.org/articles/todo)).

Even SwiftLint complains about them: `""TODOs and FIXMEs should be resolved""`.

But it should be noted that, in quite a few development teams it is a common practice to split a feature into several small pull requests that are easier to code review. This technique may lead to a situation where you need to leave a TODO comment in the code of one PR, that will be resolved in the next.

There may also be situations where you only want to mark (and possibly explain) a non-fatal defect in the code (e.g. a performance issue). This could be the case if the fix required is beyond the scope of the task you are committed to at that particular time.

So, given that a handful of developers and teams will continue to use them, IMO `todo_attribution` rule should be added to ensure that it is easy to keep track of TODOs and FIXMEs. The alternative is risking for them to be lost and forgotten and never resolved.

Best `todo_attribution` selling points are that:

- as it enforces the format, it becomes easier to find TODOs and FIXMEs with a simple text search;
- as it makes mandatory to relate the comment with a developer or a tracked issue, it points you to a source of information about the signaled problem.

> 2. Provide several examples of what would and wouldn't trigger violations.

**Non-triggering examples:**

- `TODO: @hectr do something`
- `TODO: #2871`
- `TODO: @hectr #2871 implement`
- `FIXME: @hectr`
- `FIXME: #2871 fix`

**Triggering examples:**

- `TODO: #`
- `ToDo: @hectr`
- `To-Do`
- `TO-DO: #2871`
- `todo`
- `to-do do something`
- `FIXME: ` ` @hectr assumes valid input`
- `FixMe ...`
- `Fix-Me`
- `FIX-ME`
- `fixme#2871`
- `fix-me`

> 3. Should the rule be configurable, if so what parameters should be configurable?

It seems reasonable to use `SeverityConfiguration` because you may want to be aware of this violation without fixing it immediately.

> 4. Should the rule be opt-in or enabled by default? Why? See README.md for guidelines on when to mark a rule as opt-in.

This rule fits well in the ""*A rule that is not general consensus or is only useful in some cases*"" category for 2 reasons:

- it enforces a very specific format for TODO and FIXME comments;
- TODOs and FIXMEs are not allowed by `todo` rule, which is enabled by default.",hectr,3621110

For exemple, this code will trigger a warning:

```swift
enum Foo {
  case caseOne(propOne: Int)
}

let testA: Foo = .caseOne(propOne: 2)

if case let Foo.caseOne(propOne) = testA { }

while this one will not:

enum Foo {
  case caseOne(propOne: Int)
}

let testA: Foo = .caseOne(propOne: 2)

switch testA {
  case let .caseOne(propOne): break
}
```

On `if case Enum.case(variable) = enum` the parent of the variable structure is of `call` type, because of this the current validation for `switch` and `cases` are not working

I was in doubt if a better solution would be:
* Verify if the parent of the variable declaration is a call, and this caracterizes a `if case let`
* Verify if the words before call are `if case`

I think the first one seems to follow better the pattern I saw on the code, but I am not comfortable assuming every combination of ""Parent: Call, child: Var"" is indeed a `if case let` situation. With this one, checking if the grandparent of the var is an if statement should also be good, what makes it even more complicated.

The second one seems a little bit inefficient, but is clear when reading and seems more assertive to me.",cmillani,7899093

Consider following enum:

```
enum Foo {
    case single(Int)
    case double(Int, Int)
    case triple(Int, Int, Int)

    var sum: Int {
        switch self {
        case .single(let x):
            return x
        case .double(let x, let y):
            return x + y
        case .triple(let x, let y, let z):
            return x + y + z
        }
    }
}
```

Enabling `pattern_matching_keyword` would enforce following code:

```
enum Foo {
    case single(Int)
    case double(Int, Int)
    case triple(Int, Int, Int)

    var sum: Int {
        switch self {
        case .single(let x):
            return x
        case let .double(x, y):
            return x + y
        case let .triple(x, y, z):
            return x + y + z
        }
    }
}
```

However, in this case `let`s are not in the same place. `let` is either before or after identifier depending on number of parameters. 

This PR allows you to specify in `.swiftlint.yml`:

```
pattern_matching_keyword:
  max_declarations: 0
```

and then example code will look like this:

```
enum Foo {
    case single(Int)
    case double(Int, Int)
    case triple(Int, Int, Int)

    var sum: Int {
        switch self {
        case let .single(x):
            return x
        case let .double(x, y):
            return x + y
        case let .triple(x, y, z):
            return x + y + z
        }
    }

with PR #1604 for issue #1531. At the time it was necessary as

path check.

At the moment, if you load configuration from different path than root
path **and** you also have configuration file in root path then it is
skipped. Now that configuration merging is supported, it is more
correct to merge them.

Example where `Level3/.swiftlint.yml` is skipped:
`swiftlint lint --config ../.swiftlint.yml --path Level3`

```
Level2

There are a couple of different solutions to this problem.

1. `AppKit` has `NSSpellChecker`. Although this would introduce another dependency.
2. Bundle a default dictionary with a fitting license. 
3. Have no default dictionary and let the user download and use whatever dictionary they choose.

Changes:

- `OpeningBraceRule` now uses `OpeningBraceRuleConfiguration`. Using `first_line_excluding_regex `, we can configure the keywords which should be excluded when in a multiline statement. 

#### Example 1

In the default configuration, the following code triggers a violation:
```swift
func abc(
   a: Int,
   b: Int
) -> Int
↓{ … }
```

When we add `func` into the `first_line_excluding_regex` configuration, the violation is gone:
```swift
[""first_line_excluding_regex"": ""if|guard|while|func \\w+\\(""]
/ ... /

func abc(
   a: Int,
   b: Int
) -> Int
{ … }
```

#### Example 2

The default configuration allows multiline `if` statements:
```swift
if
   let a = b
   let c = d
   where a == c
{ … }
```

If we remove `if` from `first_line_excluding_regex`, the same code now triggers a violation:
```swift
[""first_line_excluding_regex"": ""guard|while""]
/ ... /

if
   let a = b
   let c = d
   where a == c
↓{ … }

Posting it here to gather feedback and highlight some of the changes/decisions.

Missing:
- [ ] Handle nested configurations
- [ ] Add tests for caching
- [ ] Show remote rules in `swiftlint rules` (although I don't think this is *necessarily* a blocker)
- [ ] Allow plugins to expose more than one rule (depends on https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/pull/2536)
- [ ] Documentation

Will be done later:
- [ ] Create APIs on `SwiftLintFramework` that a plugin can use to register a rule. My idea is to allow users to create a rule using the existing types (`Rule`, `ASTRule`, etc) and just call a register method. Something like this:

```swift

struct MyRule: Rule { 
 // ...
}

let plugin = Plugin()
plugin.register(rules: [MyRule.self])
plugin.run()
```

- [ ] Revise public APIs on `SwiftLintFramework`. In order to be productive, we should consider exposing (a lot) of the convenience functions/types/extensions that are currently `internal`. However, this increases the public API surface. I don't think that too many people use `SwiftLintFramework` directly, so I'm not sure how important it's to not break things.

is set to `false` but fails to ignore dictionary type declarations. This PR attempts to fix that issue.

This is marked as WIP because some tests still fail and I consider my fix a little bit rough. I'd like to get some help to better understand why some tests are failing and what would be the proper way to fix them. If the general logic is OK then I can clean the code and extract it into a separate function.

Also I'd like to check with a maintainer if the general direction of my fix is OK. This is my first dive in SwiftLint's code base and want to make sure that I'm not missing anything.

As far as I can tell, the colon rule is implemented by matching a regex against each file to check statements where the `:` character is used and there are white spaces to the left followed by an identifier. Both identifier on the left and on the right of the `:` character are captured on a group and then SourceKitten is used to see what type of token the captured identifier represents.

My first idea was to modify the regex expression but I think it would make the expression way more complicated. So the patch I'm proposing checks if the `apply_to_dictionaries` configuration flag is set to `false` and then it filters out matching violations (raised by the regex) if both identifiers to the left and the right of the `:` characters are type identifiers. The left type identifier should be preceded by a `[` (ignoring white spaces) and the right type identifier should be proceeded with a `]` (also ignoring white spaces). This is what I consider to be a valid dictionary type declaration. Is this definition of dictionary type declaration correct? Am I missing any edge cases?

I realize that this may have the performance overhead of capturing false positive by the regexp which would latter be discarded but I think is a reasonable trade off to be made for readability sake. But I guess some performance metrics should be used to decide whether my assumption is correct. ",guidomb,390645

It is marked work in progress since the discussion of the proposition is still open.

There's a new unit test to check the proposed merging policy. The current implementation fulfills this test.
Nevertheless, there are still some open todos:

- Adapt implementation
  - still depending on extending all ConfigurationProviderRule implementations, although it is not necessary (experimentally applied to CyclomaticComplexityConfiguration.swift)

- Check Reflection as a dependency
  - The current implementation uses reflection to retrieve the `configuration` property of a ConfigurationProviderRule. Since Swift4 does not allow to check conformance with protocols using associated types, that's currently a working solution.

- Fix circleCI checks
- PR on Reflection (if it stays)

Additionally, added two new rules: `duplicated_imports` and `imports_at_top`

### Added
* `duplicated_imports` rule which checks for duplicated imports
* `imports_at_top` rule which checks if all imports are placed at top of the file regardless of comments

### Fixes
* `sorted_imports` rule: 
   - `ignore_case` option added to configuration, by default the rule will be case insensitive.
   - Grouping imports by importation kind (`class`, `enum`, `func`, etc., [Import Declaration from Apple Docs](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/Declarations.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH34-ID354))

After erasing the query in the search bar of GIFs, the grid was not rendered again with an initial state (it should show trending GIFs)
I've modified the search function so that the user can see the initial grid if the query is empty.
I build Signal on a real device and tested my code.

On the flake8 test selection, this PR focuses on __runtime safety and program correctness__.  This PR does _not_ focus on ""_style violations_"" (the majority of flake8 error codes that [__psf/black__](https://github.com/psf/black) can autocorrect).

* E9 tests are about Python syntax errors usually raised because flake8 can not build an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).  Often these issues are a sign of unused code or code that has not been ported to Python 3.  These would be compile-time errors in a compiled language but in a dynamic language like Python they result in the script halting/crashing on the user.
* F63 tests are usually about the confusion between identity and equality in Python.  Use ==/!= to compare str, bytes, and int literals is the classic case.  These are areas where __a == b__ is True but __a is b__ is False (or vice versa).  Python >= 3.8 will raise SyntaxWarnings on these instances.
* F7 tests logic errors and syntax errors in type hints
* F82 tests are almost always _undefined names_ which are usually a sign of a typo, missing imports, or code that has not been ported to Python 3.  These also would be compile-time errors in a compiled language but in Python a __NameError__ is raised which has the potential to halt/crash the script on the user.

1021845287,Fix invalid optional members and argument generation for typescript,2462,3946247,apache/thrift,['wontfix'],closed,1,2021-10-10T00:47:56Z,2022-04-21T07:07:23Z,2022-04-21T07:07:23Z,"Fixes two cases where the optional flag `?` is generated incorrectly for typescript, leading to invalid typescript generation that cannot pass `tsc` builds. 

### 1. Exception types with optional message

It is possible to set an optional message parameter on thrift exception types. 

```thrift
exception Bad { 
    1: string message = """";
}
```

However, for the javascript runtime, thrift exception types ultimately derive from `Error` which has a *required* message field. 

**Before**
```ts
export declare class Bad extends Thrift.TException {
    message?: string;
}

/*
Error: TS2416
Property 'message' in type 'T' is not assignable to the same property in base type 'Error'.
  Type 'string | undefined' is not assignable to type 'string'.
    Type 'undefined' is not assignable to type 'string'.(2416)
*/
```

**After**
Special case `message` fields for exception types.
```ts
export declare class Bad extends Thrift.TException {
    message: string;
}
```

### Non-optional function arguments after optional arguments
For service methods it is possible to have non-optional arguments after optional arguments, however this is *not* valid in typescript. 

```thrift
service Blah { 
    double getBlah(1: string arg1, 2: string arg2 = ""foo"", 3: string arg3);
    //                                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
}
```

**Before**
```ts
export declare class BlahClient {
    getBlah(arg1: string, arg2?: string, arg3: string): Promise<number>;
    //                                   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
}

/*
Error: TS1016
A required parameter cannot follow an optional parameter.
*/
```

**After**
Do not write non-optional parameters after optional parameters. One could argue the correct fix for this is to re-order the parameters from non-optional to optional, but this will lead to the parameter order drifting from how it is defined within the service. 
```ts
export declare class BlahClient {
    getBlah(arg1: string, arg2?: string, arg3?: string): Promise<number>;
    //                                   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
}

Each Struct/Union/Enum generated by thrift-compiler will get two methods: `read_from_in_protocol` and `write_to_out_protocol`. 
Firstly, I think these two methods are representing a certain ability of serialization, so they should be put in a trait;
Moreover, if this trait is provided, we can use trait bounding in our user codes, such as
```rust
// pseudo code
fn serialize_struct<T>(s: T) -> Vec<u8> where T: TObject {
    s.write_to_out_protocol(protocol);
    // do other things..
}
```
It could also be a pretty useful marker trait as you can see.
The name of `TObject` is only a superficial opinion, but I believe that there are enough reasons to make the trait.

The XHRClient uses the XMLHttpRequest web api to do requests. To correctly interpret binary data, the `responseType` needs to be set to `arraybuffer`, and the `response` property should be used instead of `responseText` (`response` defaults to normal text when not specified). See [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest/Using_XMLHttpRequest).

I'd like to add tests but am unsure what the best practice would be for this with regards to the project testing framework? It would involve bundling the `nodejs` lib into a browser for testing, or perhaps running a headless browser environment in nodejs? I'd be happy to add tests, but would greatly appreciate if someone could point me in the correct direction.

I'm succesfully using this fix with a C++ HTTP server using the binary protocol for my use case.

616623173,THRIFT-5127: Fix race conditions in TNonblockingServer,2142,3946247,apache/thrift,['wontfix'],closed,5,2020-05-12T12:39:19Z,2020-10-22T04:15:26Z,2020-10-22T04:15:26Z,"Client: cpp

Several race conditions were present in TNonblockingServer when
TNonblockingServer::stop() method was called concurrently with initialization of
the server (which takes place in TNonblockingServer::serve()).

 1. Thrift server uses a bidirectional pipe to notify its IO threads that they
    should exit.
    The pipe was created in the TNonblockingIOThread::registerEvents() method,
    which is called by the IO thread itself.
    Since the pipe was created _after_ the thread which was supposed to receive
    the message, there was a short time window, when such request could be
    undelivered.
    In that case, the thread would never exit and Thrift could prevent the whole
    application from terminating cleanly.
    To fix this issue, the call to createNotificationPipe() has been moved to
    the constructor of TNonblockingIOThread.
    Breaking change: the TNonblockingIOThread constructor may now throw an
    exception if pipe creation fails. However, the only caller of that
    method (TNonblockingServer::registerEvents()) could already throw due to
    unrelated errors.

 2. Accesses to TNonblockingServer::ioThreads_ vector were unsynchronized.
    In most cases this was irrelevant, because the vector is modified only
    during initialization and destruction of the server.
    However, in one scenario, creation of new threads (which may result in
    reallocation of the vector) could race with iteration over the container in
    TNonblockingServer::stop() method.
    This issue has been fixed by wrapping the code in a critical section.

610005794,THRIFT-5187: Added Win32 support for domain sockets (AF_UNIX),2127,3946247,apache/thrift,"['wontfix', 'rebase needed']",closed,8,2020-04-30T13:41:05Z,2021-02-12T15:20:07Z,2020-10-11T23:29:08Z,"This PR adds support for domain sockets for Windows.

In order to implement this change I've changed a basic property of C++ build configuration for Windows. This would not be strictly required but is quite helpful. Domain sockets are only available on recent versions of the Windows platform SDK. Therefore I've enabled the automatic configuration of `config.h` with cmake. I've checked the results and on my platform(s) the generated config header is sensible and matches the hard-coded default. However this change is not easily portable to autotools.

During the implementation I found a number of minor issues in TServerSocket and TSocket that I believe are improved in this PR. None of these changes should be a breaking change. Mostly some methods should not be called on a domain socket and have been excluded. Also, the variable `listening_` was set to `true` at the beginning of the `listen()` method but I found that this opens a small time window where `listening_` is true but the socket is not actually listening (yet).

Please review and let me know if there is anything to discuss?

I've tested this implementation successfully on MSVC 2017 and 2019, on Ubuntu 18.04 x86_64 and on MacOS 14 with XCode 11.3.

Only few tests are implemented so far both in client and in server. The goal now was to write at least some test so that I can see if it at least partially works.

Requires #2038, #2047 to work.

Server does not work yet (in linux command line app; they do work in iOS app), notifications are not delivered from NotificationCenter and I don't know how to setup it properly.

This obviously introduces a lot of failures to the cross tests.

Thank for this great project. But I think we can introduce some improvements which will be are useful for other developers.

Inspired by https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go/blob/master/examples/features/interceptor/server/main.go.

Interceptors give opportunities for:

Logging input request and response
We can log panic situation and return TApplicationException to client instead of EOF.
We can intercept request and do stuff like some validation, etc.

## Description
By moving adblocking to dnscrypt-proxy, we can add wildcard blocking to the adblocking. This pull request adds a list of wildcards and appends them to the beginning of the blocklist in the adblock.sh script.

I really wanted to then do a sweep of the domain blocklist to remove anything covered in a wildcard (akin to https://github.com/mmotti/pihole-gravity-optimise), but my shell scripting isn't nearly good enough for that. I'm not sure how it would affect speed and memory, but it would make the domain list significantly shorter.

## Motivation and Context
The blockhosts becomes list agnostic -- you no longer need to wait for the script to update with any new domains that might show up.

The cons are the extra fiddliness etc that's being introduced, the pros are that it ought to make the builds faster
So, the smart approach is to introduce it in a pull request, and then observe what the actual difference in build times looks like.

Cause the header byte pairs received from httpcore connection may be non-ascii encoded.

On the other hand, it's also possible to send `Request` with non-ascii encoded `Headers`, 

```python

headers = httpx.Headers({""foobar"": ""甲乙""}, encoding=""utf-8"")
url = ""https://httpbin.org/anything""

r = httpx.get(url, headers=headers)

Non-ascii encoded `Headers` in `Request` is not a problem for `HTTPTransport`, `AsyncHTTPTransport` and `ASGITransport`. In these transports, the headers are sent as bytes. But for `WSGITransport`, we need to decode header byte pairs and put them into a `environ` dict.

In the current implementation of `WSGITransport`, we assume the header byte pairs in `Request` are only ""ascii"" encoded. This PR extends the header encoding support in `WSGITransport`, by piggybacking the encoding detect strategy of property `Headers.encoding()`.

The proposed changes simply allow a variable when creating process/remote objects that allow the user to define the buffer size. 4096 is fine for most, so I have left that as the default.

Some reasons why it would be nice to switch to spaces:
- it's PEP8 style and for this more common
- most python editors are using spaces by default
- spaces have the same length in every editor no matter what is set in yours

933076294,[WIP] Added support for end-to-end TensorFlow graph inference,1220,3967868,ludwig-ai/ludwig,['wontfix'],closed,2,2021-06-29T20:25:57Z,2022-05-23T21:45:28Z,2022-03-03T01:14:59Z,"Serving a Ludwig model consists of three stages:

1. Preprocessing
2. Model inference
3. Postprocessing

Prior to this PR, steps (1) and (3) took place outside of the TensorFlow graph, meaning that they needed to be run in a Python interpreter during serving time. This Python dependency comes with a number of shortcomings:

1. Requires creating a complete Python environment for serving the model. This is usually in the form of a Docker image or Conda environment, which adds a lot of bloat at serving time (multiple models cannot easily served in the same server).
2. Prevents fusing operations together into a single execution environment. One advantage of having the entire model in the TF graph is being able to place it directly onto the GPU to accelerate inference. However, this existing Python steps cannot easily be placed on GPU with the rest of the model, creating a bottleneck that greatly increases latency.
3. Backwards compatibility. TensorFlow graphs are generally backward compatible for many versions, allowing us to run inference on old graphs in newer serving stacks. The same cannot be said for Python Ludwig models, where the APi is subject to change between versions.

Currently, we support input/output features of the following types:

- Numerical
- Category

I have been setting up coturn and I've had to run `apt update && apt install -y telnet` so many times to telnet in to the cli so I figured I'd try to make it easier by just adding it into the docker image.

Somos un grupo de estudiantes de la Universidad Complutense de Madrid (UCM) y estamos
haciendo una campaña de concienciación sobre el uso de licencias.

Razones por las que usar una licencia:

- Es FÁCIL de usar: escoge la licencia, copia el texto genérico y listo! Ya puedes usarla en tus proyectos. En el siguiente [link](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/licensing-a-repository) puedes encontrar más información:
- LIMITAS qué usos pueden tener las personas para usar tu contenido, de esta manera evitas problemas de copias y plagios 
- Compartir es poder! Las licencias libres te dan credito en todo momento permitiendo que otros usen tu trabajo bajo TUS condiciones.
En el siguiente [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnmWFxlG2GA) se explican los tipos de licencias para que puedas escoger una que se adapte a tus necesidades

Hemos elegido la licencia MIT para este pull request. En este [link](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) puedes encontrar mas informacion sobre esta licencia

Gracias por tu atención! Esperamos que te haya servido de ayuda

- You LIMIT the uses of your code, in this way you will avoid possible legal problems about copies and plagiarism
- Share is power! The freeware licences give to you credit all the time. Allow third people use it with YOUR conditions

## Description

Fixes #3697 

The build process has yet to comply with PEP517, causing issues for users utilising Poetry and soon more build systems. 

This MR alters some pre-existing environment variables and necessary CMake instructions when building Horovod to make a complaint build system.

An example local install now, the tar can be replaced with pypi post PR:
```
export HOROVOD_WITH_TENSORFLOW=2.8.4
pip install --no-cache-dir --use-pep517 ""horovod/dist/horovod-0.28.1.tar.gz""
```

Since PEP517 build every requirement in isolation Horovod now doesn't know which versions of TF/PyTorch are already installed. It can't see which libs to build against. 

We can set any version in `build_requires` as many users have many versions. For example, using TF 2.13.1 in the `build_requires` would cause linking issues to be reported when using in a venv with TF 2.8.4. 

To enable an isolated build whilst also respecting the users' environment, I've utilised `HOROVOD_WITH_{MXNET|PYTORCH|TENSORFLOW}` to specify versions for which the isolated build environment should install such that Horovod can now be built against the correct library specification in isolation.
Whilst also working when it is moved out of the isolated build env to its final non-isolated location. 

I've updated key error messages to alert users when they might not be using the correct env var flags.

## Description

The TF data service job introduced in #3525 can now be run as an elastic (fault-tolerant) job.

This also fixes that TF data service registers dispatcher and worker with localhost addresses, which are not accessible from remote hosts. This requires defining a nic that is to be used to connect from training to dispatcher and worker.

TODO:
- document elastic job
- test elastic job with docker containers
- remove fault-tolerant mode for dispatcher registration
- rename dispatcher-nic to general nic (for worker and dispatcher)

## Description

This enables assertion checking in the C++ code base, which should make it much easier to spot certain bugs early.

Fixes #3307. See that issue for some extended motivation.

For now I have just hard coded `HOROVOD_DEBUG=1` in `Dockerfile.test.{cpu,gpu}`. Alternatively we could configure this via `docker-compose.test.yml` and `HOROVOD_BUILD_FLAGS` only for a subset of test configuartions.

## Description

Fixes empty hostname returned from HostDiscoveryScript and make sure hostname is not empty.

Context:
When discovery script return nothing, HostDiscoveryScript will treat the empty result i.e. """" string as the available host. 
It will fail training job as launcher cannot ssh on the host with empty address. Discovery script can return nothing when no workers are available or new workers are not ready yet.

It works by mimicking the NCCL ring Allreduce using a custom algorithm that is based on CUDA-aware MPI send/receive primitives. On machines that are able to support it, it allows for much higher throughput than other Adasum operations.

Note that this current version only works on DGX1-like machines that have 8 GPUs. It could be extended to more in the future, but this was the main use case where the other two currently existing Adasum modes (CPU and Hierarchical) both have large drawbacks.

In order to use it, Horovod should be compiled with HOROVOD_GPU_ALLREDUCE=MPI and op=hvd.Adasum should be passed in to the optimizer/allreduce calls. The user needs to have a CUDA-aware MPI implementation installed (we used OpenMPI with UCX). ",vaeksare,42353187

The current implementation allows the user to enable pipelining of the `MPI_Allreduce` and `NCCLAllGather` phases of the hierarchical allreduce scheme in fixed sized chunks. The chunk size used for the pipelining is user configurable via a new environment variable `HOROVOD_HIERARCHICAL_ALLREDUCE_CHUNK_SIZE_KB`, which is the desired chunk size in kilobytes. This variable defaults to 0, which disables the pipelining feature. We may need to explore alternative options to control the chunk sizing if performance requires it. 

To enable this PR, the original `NCCLAllGather` in the scheme has been replaced with a grouped set of `NCCLBroadcast` calls which emulate the functionality of an `allgatherv` type operation. This is required for the pipeling since the reduced chunks need to be gathered into displaced locations in the result buffer. Additionally, changing to this allgatherv like operation enables simplifying the handling of ""remainder"" portions of the buffer, as now the last local rank `local_size-1` can just process the remainder portion together with its non-remainder share of the data buffer without the need for a separate `NCCLBroadcast`. 

PR is currently a work in progress pending some performance testing.

This PR changes `LocustRunner` to use per-locust structures internally and extends the `/swarm` interface to accept an `application/json` of the following format, in addition to the old `locust_count=1234&hatch_rate=10` style for backward compatibility:

```json
{
    ""FooLocust"": { ""locust_count"": 1234, ""hatch_rate"": 10.0 },
    ""BarLocust"": { ""locust_count"": 123, ""hatch_rate"": 5.5 }
}
```

In `LocustRunner`, the following attributes have been renamed, with properties added for the old names to maintain backward compatibility with existing locustfiles that use these attributes:

 - `hatch_rate` (`float``) -> `hatch_rates` (`dict` of classes -> `float`)
 - `num_clients` (`int`) -> `num_clients_by_class` (`dict` of classes -> `int`)
 - `locust_classes` (`list`) -> `locust_classes_by_name` (`dict` of `str` -> locust class)

The following `LocustRunner` methods have been extended to accept `dict` of classes -> `float/int` for their locust count and hatch rate parameters. They'll still work with the old `int` or `float` parameters though.

 - `start_hatching`

- Slower training (1 epoch CoNLL takes about 6 mins, the original implementation around 1-2 min), and I did not find the bottleneck yet. I can think of the following possible reason: Original implementation utilizes the entire sequence length of the model by concatenating sentences to a long string.

A suggestion how we could support pickle and deepcopy without having to create multiple spans etc.

The idea is to use `__getitem__` to create spans and relations by indexing: `sentence[0:5]` to create a span, `sentence[span_a, span_b]` to create a relation.

Downside would be, that those who still instantiate `Span` or `Relation` manually, would receive unexpected results.

Hi, we are security researchers from the Advanced Research Center at [Trellix](https://www.trellix.com). We have began a campaign to patch a widespread bug named CVE-2007-4559. CVE-2007-4559 is a 15 year old bug in the Python tarfile package. By using extract() or extractall() on a tarfile object without sanitizing input, a maliciously crafted .tar file could perform a directory path traversal attack. We found at least one unsantized extractall() in your codebase and are providing a patch for you via pull request. The patch essentially checks to see if all tarfile members will be extracted safely and throws an exception otherwise. We encourage you to use this patch or your own solution to secure against CVE-2007-4559. Further technical information about the vulnerability can be found in this [blog](https://www.trellix.com/en-us/about/newsroom/stories/research/tarfile-exploiting-the-world.html).

This PR introduces the integration of nebullvm, a model optimization library that enables significant acceleration in model inference. The library has been integrated for transformer models (TransformerDocumentEmbedding and TransformerWordEmbedding) following the code style of the existing Onnx export support.

The PR also features a tutorial on how to leverage the optimization.

Moreover, this PR fixes a bug (#2930) that prevented the correct export of the model to Onnx.

## Example Usage
```python
from flair.data import Sentence
from flair.models import SequenceTagger

# Load model
model = SequenceTagger.load(""ner-large"")

# Define some example sentences
sentences = [
    Sentence(""Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System.""), 
    Sentence(""In the fourth century BCE, Aristotle noted that Mars disappeared behind the Moon during an occultation.""),
    Sentence(""Liquid water cannot exist on the surface of Mars due to low atmospheric pressure.""),
    Sentence(""In 2004, Opportunity detected the mineral jarosite.""),
]

# Optimize with nebullvm
model.embeddings = model.embeddings.optimize_nebullvm(sentences)

# Inference
sentence = Sentence('George Washington went to Washington.')
model.predict(sentence)
```

## Results

With nebullvm the inference speed of the mode can be significantly improved, with the model used in the example we found the following results:

| Machine Type   | Baseline (s) | Nebullvm - optimized (s) | Speedup |
|----------------|--------------|--------------------------|---------|
| M1             | 0.181        | 0.0358                   | 5.1x    |
| Intel CPU      | 0.206        | 0.0953                   | 2,2x    |
| GPU (Tesla T4) | 0.0266       | 0.0129                   | 2.1x    |

This way, it would be easier to compute uncertainty scores used for [active learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.05928). I made experience in prior projects, that that way one could save up to 40% labelling costs.

Example:
```
loaded_model: SequenceTagger = SequenceTagger.load(""ner-fast"")

sentence1 = Sentence(""I love Berlin"")
sentence2 = Sentence(""I love vienna even more"")

loss, count = loaded_model.predict([sentence1, sentence2], return_loss=True)
```
Here `loss` would be a numpy array with 2 entries, Representing the loss per sentence.

Notice: This is so far just a proposal, I have not tested if everything works properly (for example assure that the order is right), I am currently not sure if this makes sense and if so, how to design it best (We could for example add a field `loss` to the sentence instead.)",helpmefindaname,26192135

currently not tested on larger training, but at least it runs through when using CONLL_03 downsampled to 0.005 on each dataset.

## Inner working:
while the original masks out embeddings, I decided to precompute them once at the start and create several models which different concatinations. As StackedEmbeddings overwrite the embedding name, I cannot use it. So `AceEmbeddings` act as fake dummy to load the precomputed embeddings with the right size. For each ""Episode"", a new Model is created which will be initialized with the parameters of the previous models. Only the imput weight will be modified to only use the nodes connected to the respective embeddings. (e.g. if you trained on a size of 7500 as full embedding, the first layer will be of size 7500\*x. The Second training only uses embeddings for size 3750, so only parts of the weight of the first layer will be used (3750\*x))
At the end, a final model will be created and returned by the `trainer.train` method. 

## Usage on CONLL:

Currently, I use the following for training. (besides downsample the CONLL dataset).
If someone has time and resources to try to reproduce the actual results of the ACE and share results, this would be very welcomed :-)

```
embeddings = [
        WordEmbeddings(""glove""),

    ]
    corpus = CONLL_03()
    label_type = ""ner""
    label_dict = corpus.make_label_dictionary(label_type=label_type)

    trainer = AceTrainer(
        corpus,
        embeddings=embeddings,

            hidden_size=800, tag_dictionary=label_dict, tag_type=label_type, use_crf=True, reproject_embeddings=2048

    )

    model, history = trainer.train(""resources/ace"", inner_train_args=dict(learning_rate=0.1, mini_batch_size=32, max_epochs=150))
```

## considerations

The way it is currently implemented, the Embeddings are be expected to be precomputable and stored on cpu ram. This leads to problems (for strange reasons also for my GPU ram). I will be testing using only half of the training set of CONLL_03.

I am currently not sure how good the practical use really is. It is neat if you have much ram and lots of time, that you can finetune plenty of FLERT-like models (Bert, Roberta, Deberta, XLM-Roberta, etc.) and then try to find the best concatenation of those. The Authors mentioned using 42 GPU-Hours for training and the prediction speed will likely be low when using several transformers at once, but maybe there are some usecases where the straight-up accuracy will be more beneficial.


## other changes
* nicer names for some embeddings. WordEmbeddings & FlairEmbeddings had the full path as names. Now it is the filename without ending.
* reintroduced an integer parameter for `reproject_embeddings` in the `SequenceTagger`. I don't know why it was removed, but I wanted to use it as the dynamic size would mess up the way I reuse the parameters from model to model.
* training won't anneal on dev set when the param_selection_mode is activated (or when no dev set is provided)",helpmefindaname,26192135

Add unit scaling to the tqdm progress bar, which is used to track file downloading progress.

## Rationale:
It is quite uninformative to see a million-scale number in the progress bar when downloading large files. The scaled number is much more useful, as it is what we see on a daily basis when downloading files through the browser or checking connectivity speed in speedtest. Fortunately, tqdm itself is able to accurately scale numbers to their standard scaled variants: 12456098 B/s -> 12.4 MB/s. It can be enabled via `unit_scale` option in tqdm constructor.

Other popular libraries, that deal with downloading large files, are using unit_scale in their progress bars:

Let us use the 20 Newsgroups data set, see http://qwone.com/~jason/20Newsgroups/.

I followed the procedure described in https://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/text_analytics/working_with_text_data.html for downloading and extracting the data.

Here is a short piece of code, which shows how to create a list of records for a selected set of Newsgroups data.

```
import pandas as pd

categories = ['alt.atheism', 'soc.religion.christian', 'comp.graphics', 'sci.med']

from sklearn.datasets import fetch_20newsgroups

twenty_train = fetch_20newsgroups(subset='train', categories=categories, shuffle=True, random_state=42)

df = pd.DataFrame(zip((twenty_train.target_names[_] for _ in twenty_train.target), twenty_train.data), columns=('category', 'text'))
# df.head()

records = df.to_dict(orient='records')
```

Now, let's create JSON data.

```
import json 

data_json = json.dumps(records)

with open('20news.json', 'w+') as f:
    f.write(data_json)

# with open('20news.json') as f:
#     data_json = f.read()
```

Allright, the hard work is done. We have saved our classification data in a JSON data file. 

Our final step is to  create a JSONDataset in Flair. This is really easy, 

```
# 1. Read JSON data string

#15099 introduced a bug for metrics utilizing label names that conflict with existing 'special' names: chart, dimension, family, instance.

This bug results in duplicate labels, which Prometheus will reject on intake.

My fix here is simply to ignore adding the chart label if the name matches an existing special name. However, one may prefer to overwrite the existing label, so I am not sure if this should be the final fix.

##### Test Plan

1. Compile Branch and start netdata.
2. Download a coredns binary. One may use the sample Corefile below as a basic configuration. 
3. Run coredns like `./coredns -conf ./conf`. This starts coredns to listen on port 1053.
4. Make a visit or two to the server: `dig @127.0.0.1 -p 1053 example.com`
5. Check the chart labels. I am grepping for 'requests_total' as this is the coredns metric which utilizes a 'family' label. `https://localhost:19999/api/v1/allmetrics?format=prometheus | grep 'requests_total'` 

Below is the sample coredns configuration to have a basic running coredns:
```
(snip) {
    prometheus
    log
    errors
}

.:1053 {
    whoami
    import snip
}
```

##### Additional Information

As mentioned above, there are some consequences which may not be preferred. Namely whether the chart label should override the existing label, or vice versa. That said, the current implementation is broken because it results in duplicate labels which cannot be imported into Prometheus so some decision needs to be made.

Add an ethtool collector to retrieve especially the bandwidth of Mellanox boards. Indeed there was no existing plugin that supported the Mellanox connect-X5 or connect-X6. The ethtool tool gives the number of bytes received. Given this value the collector calculates the bandwidth in Gib/s and give also a percentage of the bandwidth used according to the capabilities of the board. Besides this collector provides also number of packet loss in reception and transmission. This could be useful to detect a bottleneck on a server.

##### Test Plan
This collector have been tested on a connect-X5 and connect-X6 on cent OS servers. As long as the ethtool is installed, this collector should give its metrics.

Created in collaboration with @mikerenfro
Creates a new plugin for pulling GPU metrics. It was noted that on our cluster nvidia_smi was using significant amounts of CPU while running. 

There was a suggestion on #10362 that using  `--query-gpu=... --format=csv` would reduce resource usage.
This plugin now collects fewer metrics and uses less resources.

Addresses #10362

##### Test Plan
<!--
Provide enough detail so that your reviewer can understand which test cases you
have covered, and recreate them if necessary. If our CI covers sufficient tests, then state which tests cover the change.
-->
We ran the plugin on our cluster and noted that:
 - The nvidia-smi executable uses little CPU and runs very quickly during data collection for this plugin
 - The results appear on our Netdata graphs
 - Acts as a drop-in replacement for the other nvidia_smi plugin

We haven't written any tests specific to this plugin, but if we need to and someone can point us at resources to make tests, we can do so.

-->
The script gives less metrics overall than the main nvidia_smi plugin. It is effectively an under-the-hood change that makes the plugin use less resources to run. Because it uses less resources, a user would be able to make use of more of the resources on a core with Netdata competing for less. This allows for user-facing work to run faster with less interference from Netdata.

This PR adds `AI_ADDRCONFIG` flag

> If hints.ai_flags includes the AI_ADDRCONFIG flag, then IPv4
       addresses are returned in the list pointed to by res only if the
       local system has at least one IPv4 address configured, and IPv6
       addresses are returned only if the local system has at least one
       IPv6 address configured.  The loopback address is not considered
       for this case as valid as a configured address.  This flag is
       useful on, for example, IPv4-only systems, to ensure that
       getaddrinfo() does not return IPv6 socket addresses that would
       always fail in connect(2) or bind(2).


It is not a proper fix, but a workaround, and the flag seems good in general. It fixes the problem for all my (static build) Netdatas instances.

> **Warning** according to the https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/QA/Networking/NameResolution/ADDRCONFIG article AI_ADDRCONFIG is not reliable and something you do not want to use, but I didn't find any no-go for us.

1243193622,Add support for detectiong cloud instance info using cloud-init.,12974,3990212,netdata/netdata,"['wontfix', 'area/daemon']",closed,1,2022-05-20T14:03:46Z,2022-08-15T12:53:18Z,2022-08-13T17:56:47Z,"##### Summary

This gives us immediate support for a wide variety of additional cloud providers in our system info detection, and also allows us to provide more information on certain providers.

Adds three new variables to the script output:
- `NETDATA_INSTANCE_CLOUD_PLATFORM`: Identifies the particular hosting platform in use. For example, this differentiates between EC2 and Lightsail on AWS.
- `NETDATA_INSTANCE_CLOUD_INSTANCE_ZONE`: Identifies the availability zone information for the domain, if we can determine it.
- `NETDATA_INSTANCE_CLOUD_DETECTION`: Identifies how the cloud instance info was obtained. Will either be `cloud-init`, or identify the particular IMDS that was queried.

This also makes a minor change in semantics for the `NETDATA_INSTANCE_CLOUD_PROVIDER` variable, which will now be all lowercase (this is the format returned by `cloud-init`, and thus is needed for consistency).

In the event that `cloud-init` is not available, or `cloud-init query` returns an error (this may be the case on a system where `cloud-init` is installed, but the `cloud-init` service did not run on system startup), we fall back to the existing direct IMDS query code that supports AWS and GCP.

##### Test Plan

This needs tested on at least AWS and GCP with and without `cloud-init` installed. Note that for this to work, the `cloud-init` functionality designed to be run on system startup needs to have run.

In both cases, the previously existing `NETDATA_INSTANCE_CLOUD_*` variables should be identical with and without `cloud-init`, while the newly added variables should be different in the two cases (`unknown` without `cloud-init` for the platform and instance zone variables, and an appropriate identifier in the detection variable).

##### Additional Information

<details> <summary>For users: How does this change affect me?</summary>
With this change, a wider variety of cloud providers will be supported when querying provider and instance information to display on Netdata Cloud.

This PR adds the following improvements:

- do not query K8s API for [pause](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/tree/master/build/pause) containers (a container that holds the network namespace for the pod).
- cache (store on the host filesystem) `/api/v1/pods` response and check it before querying K8s API (only for containers).
- simplifies renaming code.

---

##### Test Plan

- K8s (requires adding debug logging messages)
  - check pause container identification logic.
  - check that cache works (hit/miss).
- run N docker containers, check name resolution works.

##### Summary
Proposal: notifications should include a relevant extract from the system logs. This is a first attempt at implementing a Logwatch snapshot to come with notifications. It adds a section to the HTML email template, and runs a simple Logwatch command to get relevant system logs and state from 1 minute before and after the alert was raised.  On a test by hand, a snapshot configured this way was helpful in resolving three of my own alerts... so I feel like this is a reasonable place to begin.

I'm _not_ sure if this is the right place to put the logic, though. Seems weird to have a View and the code behind it in one file. Tried to follow the examples in the rest of the codebase though. 

I'm not sure how to test this in my own kubernetes installation with cloud, either. Would love some advice there or others who can test it more directly. :)

---

- we shouldn't run `netdata-claim.sh` script if there is no `/var/lib/netdata/registry/netdata.public.unique.id`. That is the case on [the first container start](https://learn.netdata.cloud/docs/agent/claim#using-environment-variables). `netdata.public.unique.id` is not generated at that point.

---

Current logic is to execute `netdata-claim.sh` in the [`run.sh`](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/blob/2bddc7a0f4ad406bf45f526a853b3d025839bc3b/packaging/docker/run.sh#L23-L28). If the script fails netdata containers fails to start, docker engine keeps restarting it. 

This PR makes netdata daemon to execute `netdata-claim.sh` script. It means that container no longer fails to start if there are some problems with claiming.

If current behaviour (claim script fails => containers fails to start) is intentional, then it is buggy - there are a lot of different claim errors and we shouldn't exit with code != 0 on some of them, for instance

https://github.com/netdata/netdata/blob/a3ada604962b126b20c86a41e8aac5ca451b8a33/claim/netdata-claim.sh.in#L59-L60

It is not really a problem to do a claim being already claimed, Cloud handles it (that is our default helmchart setup btw - execute claim script on every container start/re-creation).

- apps_groups.conf # add edgex reference

##### Additional Information

[EdgeX Platform](https://www.edgexfoundry.org/)is a vendor-neutral open source project hosted by The Linux Foundation building a common open framework for IoT edge computing.  At the heart of the project is an interoperability framework hosted within a full hardware- and OS-agnostic reference software platform. It has over 1 million docker pulls.

**Github:** https://github.com/edgexfoundry
**Mono-repo:** https://github.com/edgexfoundry/edgex-go

EdgeX currently does not offer a monitoring solution out-of-the-box and **Netdata** could play an ideal role in aiding system administrators that monitor hundreds of different IoT devices. **Netdata is lightweight enough** (and can be optimized even further) to be relevant in a Linux-based EdgeX-Powered IoT use-case.

At the moment, the system-management component is under heavy development and does not offer an aggregate view of the system through a single endpoint, but rather the collector uses the API endpoints of each microservice to get metrics and view of the system.

For this reason, the collector's functionality is somewhat limited (in context with what information it _could_ provide), but **it can serve as a testbed** for the integration of the two platforms and contribute to **shaping the development of the system-management component** and its metrics sub-component.

##### Current Functionality:

- Readings/second
- Events/second
- Absolute number of Events/Readings
- Number of registered devices
- Memory Metrics for core services (edgex-core-data, edgex-core-metadata, edgex-core-command, edgex-support-logging). These metrics are generated using the Golang [runtime Package](https://golang.org/pkg/runtime/#ReadMemStats).

It does not poll every edgex microservice, but rather the core services that perform most of the functionality. Support-logging is assumed as core because it is an essential component of each EdgeX installation.

##### Some comments on Edgex.chart.py

The script is based on the example of elasticsearch. It polls several different urls and will have to poll several more if we are to include every edgex service that is currently offered by the official release **Fuji**.

Please do comment on any tips on improving the performance of the module.",odyslam,13405632

##### Additional Information
Collector is disabled by default since it needs to be configured with user/pass

From personal experience, I've restricted the cache_id and cache_server to only 1 result per job. I've searched through the Memcachier documentation and did tests with multiple caches per user to confirm this behavior. This is explained in the README as well.

I've purposefully left out the following metrics:
    ""auth_cmds"": 0,
    ""auth_errors"": 0,

Fix: #5616

Suggested `next_run` calculation method has bug - first run is delayed up to `update_every` seconds, which is a problem if `update_every` value is high. 

```java

        * find the time of the next loop
        * this makes sure we are always aligned
        * with the netdata daemon

This PR fixes the bug for `python.d.plugin`. 
`now - (now % 1) + 1` is used for first run calculation regardless of the `update_every` value.

##### Summary
Simple PrometheusService added.

https://github.com/netdata/netdata/issues/4730

requirements:
  * `prometheus_client` package

##### Component Name
`collectors/python.d.plugin/python_modules/bases/FrameworkServices`
##### Additional Information

 It literally just a `UrlService` which parses data with `prometheus_client.parser.text_fd_to_metric_families` parser.

Service returns list or [Metrics](https://github.com/prometheus/client_python/blob/4884cb3f75bef42ceb7ee98f2d7d57296546aa51/prometheus_client/metrics_core.py#L14-L21).

All additional functionallity will be added via helpers functions.

like
```python
def get_metric_by_name(metrics, name):
    for metric in metrics:
        if metric.name == name:
            return metric
    return None

It uses `mlock()` to lock the currently used part of the database into RAM, which `msync()` every a few minutes.

This is how it works:

1. netdata tries to distribute all `mlock()` and `msync()` calls through time. By default it uses `pagesize / sizeof(storage_number)` which on x86/x64 systems leads to 1024 seconds. So, netdata evenly distributes the `mlock()` and `msync()` call through out this time.

   I experimented with 60 seconds and 600 seconds too. These led to increased I/O due to the frequency of the `msync()` calls. There is a setting that controls this `[global].sync to disk every = 1024`.

2. each chart, together with all its dimensions, is synced just once on every such period.

3. The `mlock()` and `msync()` calls are following the area of the RRD files, netdata works on. So, on an empty database, the first area is locked, then as data are written the previous sections are unlocked and synced and new sections get locked. This is done at page boundaries.

**However, all these seem do not make any difference.** The opposite actually: due to `msync()` the system is experiencing more I/O.

I have added a few more charts to monitor this locking and syncing. They are at the netdata section, `mlock` sub-section:

The last chart above, shows that netdata syncs at most 500KB per second.

However the system still flushes up to 100MB:

I has been said that `msync()` is actually faulty in Linux: https://lwn.net/Articles/502612/
However recent kernels seem to have patches that make it work properly: https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/7fc34a62ca4434a79c68e23e70ed26111b7a4cf8

holding the stdout lock, waiting on the main thread to process the write
action.

There may be reasons we don't want to allow nested calls to
`emscripten_current_thread_process_queued_calls` but technically its
seems possible.

- The following functions and properties are available in JavaScript while using `std::vector` directly.
  - `concat` ¹
  - `copyWithin`
  - `entries` ²
  - `every`
  - `fill`
  - `filter`
  - `find`
  - `findIndex`
  - `forEach`
  - `from`
  - `includes`
  - `indexOf`
  - `join`
  - `keys` ²
  - `lastIndexOf`
  - `length`
  - `map`
  - `pop`
  - `push` ¹
  - `reduce`
  - `reduceRight`
  - `reverse`
  - `shift`
  - `slice`
  - `some`
  - `sort`
  - `splice` ¹
  - `toLocaleString`
  - `toString`
  - `unshift` ¹
  - `values` ²
  - ¹ _The variable argument syntax variations are not implemented as I do not know how to do this with Embind._
  - ² _These functions are iterable,_
- Since JavaScript does not support overloading the `[]` operator, `get` and `set` continue to be used instead, although they now support negative indexing.
- Since `std::vector` doesn't support undefined elements, `resize` is also retained.
- This is implemented as a new vector wrapper to avoid breaking existing JavaScript code that depends on the std::vector style API.

Here is the example from the test case...
```
vector<double>(""DoubleVector"", ""DoubleVectorIterator"", ""DoubleVectorValue"");
```

Notice that names must be provided for the vector wrapper along with the iterator and iterator value.  This result can be extended with `.function`, `.class_function`, `.property`, and `.class_property` if desired in the same manner as `class_`.

In JavaScript, the vector can be used like an Array, without requiring copying back and forth...

```
const vector = module.DoubleVector.from([1, 2, 3]);
for (const element of vector) {
    console.log(element);
}
vector.delete();

we have had massive problems with deadlocks with emscripten due to proxy to main thread calls.

For example if a worker-thread holding a mutex tries to allocate/deallocate memory and the main thread is then executing additional functionality, because other calls were queued on the main thread as well, trying to obtain the same mutex. This happens a lot in our Qt based application by signal/slot or invokeMethod calls.

To avoid this I introduced a new function emscripten_current_thread_process_proxied_queued_calls which replaces emscripten_current_thread_process_queued_calls and emscripten_sync_run_in_main_runtime_thread_ in situations were it would be dangerous to execute something else than proxied calls.

For us this worked very well.

Regarding a test case I'm unsure, I should be able to come up with something which reproduces the original issue, but I first seek feedback whether the solution might have unwanted side effects I just don't see yet.

Kind regards,
Alex",AlexanderJ,128691

Instead of introducing more complicated code paths to the existing detection mechanics, this patch provides a simple hook to override `scriptDirectory` from the call-site to enable use-cases like:

```js
// in Deno, window is globally defined without document
//
// import DOM API and assign `window.document` as desired
import jsdom from ""https://dev.jspm.io/jsdom"";
window.document = new jsdom.JSDOM(null, { url: 'http://localhost' }).window.document;

// window.fetch exists, but cannot read from local filesystem (as of Deno `v1.3.3`)
//
// modify the meaning of fetch API for local filesystem reads
// (both before and after are the async methods)
window.fetch = Deno.readFile;

const basePath = './';

// dynamically load the module in order to inject the desired (document and fetch) dependencies
const myModule = await import(basePath + 'myModule.js');

// finally get the instance with the desired `scriptDirectory`
const app = await myModule.default({ scriptDirectory: basePath });
```

---

PS: this is just a nice-to-have change to align the values of `scriptDirectory` with ES6 and ES5 builds during the run time, as my aforementioned use-case is unblocked by providing binary buffer to `wasmBinary` from the call sites:

```js
import jsdom from ""https://dev.jspm.io/jsdom"";
window.document = new jsdom.JSDOM(null, { url: 'http://localhost' }).window.document;

const myModule = await import('./myModule.js');
const wasmBuffer = await Deno.readFile('./myModule.wasm', 'utf8');
const app = await myModule.default({ wasmBinary: wasmBuffer });

Previously with dynCalls things were simpler as we only ever entered
the wasm via an export (to call a function pointer, we called an export
that did the call for us). To rewind table calls, add them to the stack
of called things.

This is not very optimized - it just serializes the function pointer and
params as a string. We should look into optimizing it, but that would
take a refactoring of how we store ids for rewinding etc., so I think
it's better to get it working first and look into optimizations later.

although I am thinking of restylizing this to similar format of emdump before landing.

Btw, it was originally proposed that `emdump` should reside in the root directory, but that [was rejected](https://github.com/emscripten-core/emscripten/pull/6967#issuecomment-411823457) citing that the tool was not useful enough, and not tested. Now I see that there is a utility `emsize` that was added in #9663, which is quite objectively even less useful than `emdump`. I think the review process has not been very consistent here.

The reason I am raising that up is that there is a big conveniency/ux aspect to having a tool reside in root directory of Emscripten vs in a subdirectory: if the tool is placed in the root directory, one can invoke it easily with

```bash
/home/clb/myproject$ emdump myfile.js
```

when one has Emscripten in PATH, e.g. by having an active EMSDK command prompt set.

Whereas in a tools subdirectory, one will need to type

```bash
/home/clb/myproject$ python $EMSCRIPTEN/tools/emdump.py myfile.js
```
(or `$EMSCRIPTEN/tools/emdump myfile.js` depending on whether exec stubs are present) to run the tool, which is much more inconvenient.

I would argue the benefit of `emsize` is a bit vague in comparison with this new `size_report.js` tool. I would be happy to place `size_report.js` to the root directory under e.g. the name `emdump`, or replace `emsize` with this.

simple webservers work properly even if they don't set the mimetype,
getting the benefits of streaming, and not first failing to stream and
then doing the less-optimal path.

This makes our code a little smaller, and simpler too. Worth doing
just for that (assuming there is no other downside) - specifically, when
instantiation failed for a non-mimetype reason the error could be hard
to understand, which this would avoid.

It happens that since emscripten moved to upstream instead of fastcomp, the emcc.py did got some revamp and the Boost bjam compilation process requires to find a keyword version in front of the version number to determine the clang version it's using to perform the build and select cxx features etc.

As it considers em++ is a clang (which is true) it looks for the clang version in the form ""version x.x.x"".

What works in the tests I have is by adding the version on another line, as I was afraid of breaking potentially other stuffs like configure which looks for different patterns, but perhaps everything could be added on the same line.

Which tests should I run to check my changes are correct ?

Thank you very much for the awesome work  :wink:

These implementations are relying on the legacy GL emulation layer (GLImmediate variable in the file, defined with LEGACY_GL_EMULATION=1).

The issue is that when someone use another GL 1.x emulation layer such as Regal, these default GLU methods implementation are not functional (because LEGACY_GL_EMULATION mode is not active)... but still they are silently linked! Hence, they are failing if called at runtime.

The error that occurs at runtime is a bit confusing, and it took me some time to figure out that I needed to link explicitly with a more regular GLU implementation in C.

So, I think it would be better to include those default GLU methods implementations only when LEGACY_GL_EMULATION is defined, and let the linker complains in all other cases: for example if someone is trying to call GLU methods without Emscripten Legacy GL Emulation enabled. 

At least, the developer know that GLU is missing and needs to be explicitly provided. This is a little bit like it is done with some GLUT methods such as glutSolidSphere, glutSolidCube, etc: they need to be provided explicitly.",gabrielcuvillier,8947618

I'm opening this PR to solve an issue I have with my setup, here is a short summary:

I'm using Conan at work to manage C++ dependencies, and we are trying to cross-build to WebAssembly with Emscripten. To do so, I created a ""Toolchain package"" which sets correct flags automatically for consumers of this package.

For CMake builds, I simply exposed the `CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE` to point to `Emscripten.cmake`.

The thing is `find_package` now fails to find any dependency, due to the `CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_PACKAGE` set to `ONLY`.

While this is a valid behavior for regular CMake use-case, it is quite inconvenient for us, since Conan packages are all located in different folders, but are still found easily with `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` being set with all the package folders' paths. However, `ONLY` prevents it from working, and I'd like to set every `MODE_XXX` setting to `BOTH`.

So I simply mimicked what's done in the Android NDK's toolchain file and added some if/endif guards around each `set()`. It allows users to specify a different value if they need. This works great for us when cross-building to Android with Conan.

Note:

I first tried to simply include Emscripten's Toolchain from a custom toolchain file, and reset those variables. However, the `CMakeSystemSpecificInformation.cmake` includes `Emscripten.cmake` right before processing the customer `CMakeLists.txt` and thus the variables are overriden with the default values.",theodelrieu,15652306

All of this was discovered in Pyodide, but I'm struggling to produce a minimal example.

On sites such as itch.io, the game area is embedded in an iframe.
Clicking on outer webpage makes the game lose keyboard focus, but clicking on the game doesn't restore it.

#7484 does not help in that case: clicking on the canvas doesn't change the focus. For a SDL2 application, finding a bit of non-canvas document area to click on is a work-around, but not suitable if the canvas auto-adjusts to the document area.

I added 2 custom events to the canvas to fix keyboard focus:
- restore window focus on mouseenter
- restore window focus also on click, since mouseenter is not triggered in all situations (e.g. at the end of a selection event that starts in the outer document and that ends with the mouse on the canvas)

The option parses the given file into key-value settings and applies them as if they were passed to -s.

There are no tests yet.

Related issues: #6057, #6069 

Implementation details:

The user-supplied settings are now stored in a dictionary instead of a list of strings. this simplifies modifying and reading them from code before loading into `shared.Settings`.

-s options and --s-from-file files are processed identically.

Rules of the new -s settings syntax:
 * the old syntax is a subset
 * key=value settings are separated by a semicolon or newline
 * every value is parsed as a list of strings or a response file
 * comments begin with #
 * whitespace is not significant
 * brackets are optional but must be used for multi-line lists
 * both commas and spaces may be used to separate list values

After parsing, values in the settings are immediately evaluated: each is converted into an int, string, or list depending on the default type of the corresponding variable.

BTW, Maybe something like json+comments should be used instead of javascript in `settings.js`? That could make it easier to process. currently when loading it into python every `//` is blindly replaced with `#`. This doesn't take into account quoted strings such as `'ws://'` (the default value of `WEBSOCKET_URL`) which becomes `'ws:#'`.

Some values in `settings.js` are represented by a single string with comma-separated words. now they can be real lists without being cumbersome for the user to type.

338038465,"Feedback wanted: Allow custom ""core JS"" replacements, to *really* shrink minimal JS sizes",6803,3990801,emscripten-core/emscripten,['wontfix'],closed,3,2018-07-03T20:10:21Z,2020-02-28T23:17:02Z,2019-09-25T21:20:34Z,"**Note:** This is just a proof of concept for feedback! Code needs a lot more work here. All proposed APIs are just some initial ideas.

The background here is that by default we include a lot of JS that supports things users might not need, like the various hooks during startup, the various input params on `Module`, etc. In very small projects their overhead is very noticeable.

What is proposed here is that we allow users to replace the ""core JS"" - the JS that sets up and starts up the application. In practice, that means the user provides some JS that replaces much of shell.js, preamble.js, and postamble.js. The ""core JS"" the user provides needs to implement two main methods:

 * `setup(info)`: this sets up the wasm Memory and Table, prepares where the stack is, etc. It receives as a parameter the location of static data (as LLVM gave us) etc.
 * `start(imports, onload)`: this starts up the application. `imports` contains the imports for the wasm module (properly connected to JS glue code, etc.), and `onload` should be called with the wasm instance as a parameter.

You can see an example core js file here: https://github.com/kripken/emscripten/blob/custom-core/src/corejs/minimal-web.js
```
// Environment setup

var out, err;
out = err = function(x) {
  console.log(x);
};

// Set up memory and table

function setup(info) {
  var memory = new WebAssembly.Memory({ initial: info.memorySize, maximum: info.memorySize });
  var table = new WebAssembly.Table({ initial: info.tableSize, maximum: info.tableSize, element: 'anyfunc' });
  var staticEnd = info.staticStart + info.staticSize;
  var stackStart = staticEnd;
  var stackMax = stackStart + info.stackSize;
  var sbrkStart = stackMax;
  var sbrkPtr = 16;
  (new Int32Array(memory.buffer))[sbrkPtr >> 2] = sbrkStart;
  return {
    memory: memory,
    table: table,
    stackStart: stackStart,
    sbrkStart: sbrkStart,
    sbrkPtr: sbrkPtr,
  };
}

// Compile and run

function start(imports, onload) {
  fetch('b.wasm', { credentials: 'same-origin' })
    .then(function(response) {
      return response.arrayBuffer();
    })
    .then(function(arrayBuffer) {
      return new Uint8Array(arrayBuffer);
    })
    .then(function(binary) {
      return WebAssembly.instantiate(binary, imports);
    })
    .then(function(pair) {
      var instance = pair['instance'];
      var exports = instance['exports'];
      onload(exports);
      exports['_main']();
    });
}
```
As you can see this is pretty short. It doesn't support all the stuff we support by default (like streaming compilation with a fallback, etc.), so it lets the user control exactly what they get.

The code size savings here are very good: a minimal hello world using EM_ASM built with `-Os --closure 1` ends up with very little code aside from the core JS itself: around **1,469** bytes of JS, just **717** bytes with gzip! This is an order of magnitude better than the normal JS we emit. Of course, the effect is smaller as you include more, for example a hello world with printf (so it ends up using syscalls for I/O) is 4x smaller - still very significant.

The downside here is that we are adding a new option, so there's some more complexity overall. However, I think it's worth it for the benefits this provides for small outputs.

If you want to try this out, build with something like this:
```
./emcc tests/hello_world.c -s ""CUSTOM_CORE_JS='/path/to/emscripten/src/corejs/minimal-multi.js'""
```

These methods print to stdout and stderr without requiring strings to be terminated with newlines. They have been added to the Module object for Node and to shell[_minimal].html for browsers. Unfortunately spidermonkey has no equivalent of putstr that prints to stderr so only rawPrint is implemented there.

In addition tty.read has been modified slightly to return when a whole line has been entered, rather than waiting for EOF.  On Node and SpiderMonkey, this makes input from stdin (e.g. scanf) work the same way as native terminals when run interactively.

I've added a new test to the 'others' suite - test_stdin2.  This is a simple prompt and response program which demonstrates the changes.  Although it is setup to run under the test suite, it's really better run interactively, since it isn't so much important what it prints as when it flushes the output to the screen and running it as an automated test doesn't really capture that subtlety.  It runs best interactively under Node as the lack of rawPrintErr under Spidermonkey causes the last prompt to not be flushed until after the response is entered.

* Implement rawPrint and rawPrintErr (see Issue #4366)
* Some tests need modifying due to output changing validly because of
  rawPrint:
  - test_exceptions_uncaught_2 and test_remove - std:cout now no longer
    automatically appends an eol, so added '<< std:endl' as needed.
  - test_fs_trackingdelegate - printf, for reasons known only to itself,
    splits its calls to 'write' into two, the first 26 characters followed
    by the remaining 2 chars.  Since rawPrint does not buffer data across
    calls to 'write', this results in the text 'Wrote to file ""/dev/tty""'
    getting output after the first 26 characters have been output.
  - test_printf - line 'no_new_line' is now not followed with a new line,
    this is valid - modified output.txt accordingly.
  - test_rounding, test_simd15 - last printf now correctly doesn't emit a
    new line - .out files modified accordingly.

By having this in -O3 and -Os, the builds most people see will be significantly smaller (around 25%). Also, doing this before closure helps a tiny bit as well.

This does add a little to compile time, and has some risks, so I suggest leaving it to -O3 and -Os, and not -O2. The risks are a subset of the risks closure does, so this is not a breaking change for code that is already correct and follows our recommendations, but in practice people might see an issue. Specifically:

 * Minified JS names means that using `eval(""someVar"")` won't work if it was minified.
 * Minified JS names in the top-level scope might collide with other things there, if people mix the script with other things.

A few of our tests actually had bugs there.

This PR also refactors the emcc.py code for deciding to preserve names, since now we can separately preserve js names and compiled code names.

285153344,Implement rawPrint and async input in browsers (requires PROXY_TO_PTHREAD),6003,3990801,emscripten-core/emscripten,"['filesystem', 'multithreading', 'wontfix']",closed,6,2017-12-29T20:48:17Z,2019-09-25T22:20:41Z,2019-09-25T22:20:41Z,"The main goal of this PR is to improve how stdio works when reading and writing to the tty, so it behaves more like the way native stdio programs behave.  The main changes are to allow for stdin input in browsers to work with an async keydown event handler rather than relying on 'prompt'. However smaller changes have been made for the benefit of Node and Spidermonkey shell.

* Implement rawPrint and rawPrintErr (see Issue #4366)

These methods print to stdout and stderr without requiring strings to be terminated with newlines.  They have been added to the Module object for Node and to shell[_minimal].html for browsers.  Unfortunately spidermonkey has no equivalent of putstr that prints to stderr so only rawPrint is implemented there.

In addition tty.read on Node and SpiderMonkey has been modified to return when a whole line has been entered, rather than waiting for EOF.

* Implement support for async input in browsers when compiled
  with USE_PTHREADS and PROXY_TO_PTHREAD.  Worker will sit in
  'wait' state until a whole line is read using a keydown event handler

On browsers things are more interesting ... currently the code uses 'prompt' to capture input as this is the only synchronous method available.  This is still the case for single-threaded builds, but if we take advantage of USE_PTHREADS and PROXY_TO_PTHREAD we can do better.

Currently when a proxied program does a read, the thread goes into 'wait' state and the syscall is proxied back to the main thread.  This captures the input using 'prompt' and then wakes the thread.

In order to allow an async method to be used to capture input, such as a keydown handler, some changes need to be made.  Accordingly a 'get_char' method is added to the Module object which is called by the tty.get_char function.  This method returns 'undefined' when there no input in its buffer, which gets translated into an EAGAIN error code.  This is then intercepted in the pthreads code and causes function emscripten_main_thread_process_queued_calls to return prematurely, leaving the read syscall on the queue and the thread still in wait state.  A simple keydown handler is also implemented, which is then left to read keystrokes as needed until 'Enter' is pressed, at which point emscripten_main_thread_process_queued_calls is called again to allow processing to continue.

For testing I've added test_stdio2 which is a modified version of test_stdio.  For node and spidermonkey this will run as part of the 'others' suite.  I haven't added this to the browser suite as it is necessarily an interactive test, but it can be run by compiling as follows:

emcc -o test_stdin2.html test_stdin2.c -g3 -s USE_PTHREADS=1 -s PROXY_TO_PTHREAD=1 -s NO_EXIT_RUNTIME=0

Then run a local webserver (e.g. python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000) and open localhost:8000/test_stdin2.html in the browser.

Incidentally, note the addition of NO_EXIT_RUNTIME=0.  I've noticed that stdio calls in the browser just seem to return error code 9 (EBADF) without this on the current incoming branch, when USE_PTHREADS and PROXY_TO_PTHREAD are used.  Is this expected behaviour for some reason or does this need investigating further?

In particular, this PR:
 - is deliberately configured to just support OGG since that's all I've tested (supporting WAV may be as easy as just removing one of the `--disable-*` flags and adding a test)
 - is sdl_mixer release 2.0.0. 2.0.2 (which has some useful fixes described in https://github.com/kripken/emscripten/issues/3985#issuecomment-339684833) requires a more recent version of sdl2 than emscripten has available (see https://github.com/emscripten-ports/SDL2/pull/52). Once sdl2 is updated, my repo has all the appropriate tags (https://github.com/aidanhs/SDL2_mixer/releases) so you should just be able to bump it.
 - requires make to build it, rather than taking the route the other ports do (hardcoding the .c files to compile with emcc)

I also took the liberty of removing some old dead code.

One deliberate thing I did is to not copy headers into the SDL2 directory, but instead set up an additional include directory which has the effect of acting like an overlay and not polluting the SDL2 directory.

To this:
```livescript

signature  = supercop.allocateBytes(64)
supercop
  .._ed25519_sign(signature, message, message.length, publicKey, privateKey)
  ..freeBytes()
signature.get()
```

Code is written in LiveScript, but it shouldn't be too difficult to read (compiled JavaScript version of the first snippet is even longer).

Besides obvious readability and usability improvements it also allows to reduce the amount of code necessary to write during module consumption, which results in smaller browser bundles.

Let's stick to implementation discussion here and use #5449 to discuss the concept in general.

Stubbed out, and reasons why:

* glfwGetMonitorPos/glfwSetWindowPos(): it is actually possible to get a window's position on the screen using `window.screenX` and `window.screenY`, and potentially to reposition it using [window.moveTo()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/moveTo), but its usage is restricted in various ways, so I left it stubbed out to do nothing but not fail (could possibly be useful to implement after multi-window support, since moveTo() should work on windows from window.open(), but out of scope of this pull request)
* glfwSetMonitorCallback(): left this stubbed, sets a function pointer but never calls it, may not be possible in general to detect when monitors are added/removed from the HTML5 platform, nor get their information... possibly useful to tie in with [WebVR](https://github.com/w3c/webvr), which allows fullscreening to a VR device, but this can come later (out of scope of this pull request).",satoshinm,26856618

For all syscalls this can sometimes be a moderate code size improvement - if the function otherwise doesn't write to the stack, we can avoid emitting a prologue/epilogue entirely (e.g. `__stdio_close`).

776881276,Add-support-for-examples-scripts-to-run-on-sagemaker,9367,3992594,huggingface/transformers,['wontfix'],closed,3,2020-12-31T08:59:41Z,2021-03-06T05:39:13Z,2021-03-06T00:13:42Z,"Hello Guys,

i am currently working on how we could edit/extend the fine-tuning scripts from `examples/` to work out-of-the-box within sagemaker. For that i adjusted the [`run_glue.py` script](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/master/examples/text-classification/run_glue.py).

To test it I created a [custom huggingface extension for sagemaker](https://github.com/philschmid/sagemaker-sdk-huggingface) where I created a sagemaker compatible docker container and a huggingface estimator.
The container was build with the `transformers==4.1.1` and `datasets==1.1.3`. That is also the reason why I only adjusted the `run_glue.py` and not any other files. The `run_glue.py` can i dynamically pass into the Sagemaker Training Job, but when i would adjust any other files yet i would have to rebuild the container... . For all the functions, which would move to a different directory I added a comment `# Should be moved to path_to_file/filename.py`.

As an Example how you could use this to create a Sagemaker training job using the extension i build you would create an `HuggingFace()` Estimator and then call `.fit()`. The example i used is demonstrated below or you can find it in this [github repostiroy](https://github.com/philschmid/sagemaker-sdk-huggingface/blob/main/examples/06_transformers_existing_training_scripts/sagemaker-notebook.ipynb)

```python
from huggingface.estimator import HuggingFace


huggingface_estimator = HuggingFace(entry_point='run_glue.py',
                            source_dir='../../transformers/examples/text-classification',
                            sagemaker_session=sess,
                            base_job_name='huggingface-sdk-extension',
                            instance_type='ml.p3.2xlarge',
                            instance_count=1,
                            role=role,
                            framework_version={'transformers':'4.1.1','datasets':'1.1.3'},
                            py_version='py3',
                            hyperparameters = {
                                'model_name_or_path': 'distilbert-base-cased',
                                'task_name':'MRPC',
                                'do_train': True,
                                'do_eval': True,
                                'max_seq_length':'128',
                                'per_device_train_batch_size':32,
                                'learning_rate':2e-5,
                                'num_train_epochs': 3.0
                            })

huggingface_estimator.fit()
```

**_Note:_ Sagemaker Requirements**  
In Sagemaker you can define Hyperparameters, which are getting passed into the training script within the `HuggingFace(hyperparameters={})` dictonary. This parameter will be then passed into the training script as named arguments. So the hyperparameters from the example are going to look like this when the training script is executed.
`--do_eval True --do_train True --learning_rate 2e-05 --max_seq_length 128 --model_name_or_path distilbert-base-cased --num_train_epochs 3.0 --output_dir Not defined sagemaker --per_device_train_batch_size 32 --task_name MRPC`.

### How I proceeded

1. I created a function `is_run_on_sagemaker()` to determine if the script is running in a Sagemaker Runtime environment. This function should be move to the `transformers/src/transformers/file_utils.py` file.

2. I had to adjust the `sys.argv` because:

   1. `TrainingArguments` are expecting the parameter `output_dir`, but in a Sagemaker Runtime the output_dir is defined from the enviroment variable `SM_OUTPUT_DATA_DIR`.
   2. `TrainingArguments` are expecting for boolean parameters not a `True` as value. If `--train_do` exist its `True` otherwise its `False`. In Sagemaker you cannot pass keys only so i removed all `True`s from the `sys.argv` at the beginning. A better solution could that we adjust the HfArgumentParser to accept `'True'` for boolean arguments.

3. Therefore i created an `parse_sagemaker_args()` function which:

   - first adds the `--output_dir` with the correct value for Sagemaker
   - Secound parses alle existing environment variables to check if the datasets are passed into training job. When you run a fine-tuning script in sagemaker you can pass data into `.fit()` which is on S3 and will be downloaded before the training starts. I added two options you can either add the the direct S3 uri to a file (e.g. `s3://my-data-bucket/path/to/my/training/data.csv`) or you can add a path (e.g. `s3://my-data-bucket/path/to/data`) and pass the file as hyperparameters `train_file`.
   - Third I had to remove all `True`s from the `sys.argv` for the boolean parameters.

4. Adjusted all file saving and model saving section and added conditions if the script is run on Sagemaker.

#### Testing

I tested it using the jupyter notebook I provided at the top. The log of the training script is attached:

For local testing you can ran this script. It will add all the required Sagemaker environment variables to the script.

```bash
export TASK_NAME=mrpc
export SM_CHANNELS=[""test"",""train""]
export SM_OUTPUT_DATA_DIR=/opt/ml/output/data
export SM_MODEL_DIR=/opt/ml/model
export M_CHANNEL_TEST=/opt/ml/input/data/test
export SM_CHANNEL_TRAIN=/opt/ml/input/data/train

  --do_eval True \
  --max_seq_length 128 \
  --per_device_train_batch_size 32 \
  --learning_rate 2e-5 \
  --num_train_epochs 3 \
```

I would love to receive suggestions for improvement.
If it looks okay for you I would move the `is_run_on_sagemaker()` to the correct path and we could merge it.

This past [PR](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/6315) replaced the argument name `n_gpu` of the distillation example with `gpus`. This causes a crash in running the example since the rest of the example code still uses the old argument name (`n_gpu`). 

This PR solves the issue and get the distillation example to run.

In addition to this, added one more argument (`--data-dir`) for custom RoBERTa models, and modified the `--classification_head` argument to take in a string rather than `store_true`. This is to reflect (a more likely case) of custom classification heads, rather than the most popular (and already available) `mnli` head. Added an import of `os` (if it counts as a ""dependency"").

753852672,Add warnings for incompatible generation parameters,8861,3992594,huggingface/transformers,['wontfix'],closed,4,2020-11-30T22:33:15Z,2021-03-06T00:15:13Z,2021-03-06T00:15:13Z,"# What does this PR do?
While testing various generation configurations, I got confused when beam_sample's outputs (i.e. `num_beams > 1, do_sample=True`) failed to change with different settings of `top_k, top_p, temperature`. Then I realized that in my call to `generate()`, `do_sample` was still set to false even though I was cycling through various settings of top_k, top_p and temperature. 

Generate (and its helper methods) already contain some parameter compatibility checks. This adds a few more checks:
- `num_beams` must be >= 1
- when `do_sample` is not set, warn the user if any of `top_p, top_k, temperature` are not None (since they will have no effect)
- if `num_beams` is 1 (no beam search), warn user if any of `early_stopping, length_penalty` are not None (since they will have no effect)
- if an invalid set of params `num_beams` and `do_sample` are passed, raise ValueError. Note that since we also add a check for `num_beams < 1`, this final value error will never be raised, but this prevents the `generate` function from falling off the end of the ifelse chain if something is altered in the future.

A new option proposed, `diverse_sequences`, for cases, when one wants really different sequences to be generated (conversational bot, for example). For greedy search, it starts generating new sequences from top `num_return_sequences` tokens (as first tokens in sequences). For sample generation mode, `num_return_sequences` first tokens are taken from a multinomial distribution.
Default `diverse_sequences=False` leaves generation in a way it was before this PR.

This PR allows BatchEncoding to have non-tensor fields. This is useful for example when doing multi-task learning, I can add a task name (str) in the batch, and use it to decide the computation later on. 
Without this PR, I cannot use `.to('cuda')` if there is str in the batch.

Fixes #8125 #8117 

Tokenizer checkpoint files are now handled the same way than model files.

Also:
- add a `tokenizer_class_name` field in the tokenization config file `tokenizer_config.json`. This field is used when possible by `AutoTokenizer` to disambiguate the tokenizer to instantiate
- concurrently configuration and vocabulary files are updated on the relevant model repo in the hub to wake them independant from the code-base.
- the max length of the models was always the same for all the variante in an architecture. Consequently we simply the `max_model_input_sizes` attribute to make it a single integer instead of a mapping from string (model names) to integers.

In `tokenization_marian.py`, the regex `>>.+<<` is used to extract the language token from the sentences leading to the following incorrect tokenization.

```

>>hin<< We use cout<< function to print a line in C++.

Current Tokenizer gives:
['<unk>', '▁function', '▁to', '▁print', '▁a', '▁line', '▁in', '▁C', '++', '.', '</s>']

Expected Tokenization:
['>>hin<<', '▁We', '▁use', '▁c', 'out', '<', '<', '▁function', '▁to', '▁print', '▁a', '▁line', '▁in', '▁C', '++', '.', '</s>']

- I submitted an issue, but never got any feedback.
- I did not update the documentation due to the fact that it doesn't exist
- I did not write tests either since I couldn't get the tests to work out on my machine. However I did test it while training the model. However I could easily write tests if you believe it's necessary.

696585735,New TF output proposal,7022,3992594,huggingface/transformers,['wontfix'],closed,11,2020-09-09T08:26:44Z,2023-06-13T14:23:01Z,2020-11-24T02:58:11Z,"Hello!

Currently the TensorFlow have several issues to properly working in graph mode when `output_attentions`, `outout_hidden_states` and `return_dict` takes a boolean tensor (`tf.constant(True/False)`). This is because the graph mode doesn't allows to have an output of different sizes in its conditional branches.

To fix this and lower as much as possible a breaking change with the current behavior of these models, I propose to keep the current behavior but only in eager mode, and disabling these three features (force to have them to False) in graph mode. This is for me the best compromise between having something that works in graph mode and not having a big breaking change.

The graph mode is most of the time used to get fast training/inference and not for doing experiments, and I don't see the point to deploy a model in production that gives you all the attentions/hidden states values, or possibly getting an OOM during the training/inference mostly for the new TFLongformer model.

Here some examples.

Example 1: run in eager mode with default parameters value
```python
from transformers import TFBertForMaskedLM

model = TFBertForMaskedLM.from_pretrained(""bert-base-cased"")
model(tf.constant([[10,11,12]]))

# Result

          -7.807548 ,  -8.135937 ]]], dtype=float32)>,)
```

Example 2: run in eager mode by updating a boolean parameter value
```python
from transformers import TFBertForMaskedLM

model = TFBertForMaskedLM.from_pretrained(""bert-base-cased"")
model(tf.constant([[10,11,12]]), return_dict=True)

```python

```
As you can see for the last example, no more graph compilation error due to the `tf.constant(True)` value.

For my examples I used only `return_dict` but of course the same behavior is applied to `output_attentions` and `output_hidden_states`. Moreover, this new behavior will be detailed in the documentation of the impacted parameters.

It shows the results of running the script: `benchmark_pytorch_scripting.py`.

In a nutshell, the script does the following: 

1) Create a list of 500 and 2500 `input_tensors` of `batch_size` 1 with a sequence length varying between 1 and 128 or 1 and 512. 
    Then take a scripted model `model = torch.jit.script(BertScriptableModel(...))` and loop over all 500 / 2500 `input_tensors` in a standard for loop. The script model is warmed up by running the loop 5 times before measuring the time. The loop is run 10 times and the fastest run is taken as a measurement.

2) Create a list of 64 and 512 input_tensors of batch_size 8 with a sequence length varying between 1 and 128 or 1 and 512. 
    Then take a scripted model `model = torch.jit.script(BertScriptableModel(...))` and loop over all 64 / 512 `input_tensors` in a standard for loop.

To run this script, one can simply run:

```
./benchmark_pytorch_scripting.py
```

**Important**:

The ""for"" loop corresponds to the function defined in lines 32 - 37 of the file `benchmark_pytorch_scripting.py`. 
This function then overwrites the function that is usually measured in benchmarks, by setting `benchmark._prepare_inference_func = _prepare_inference_func` in line 49.

It would be awesome if @sbrody18 could take a look at the `benchmark_pytorch_scripting.py` f file to check if torchscript was used correctly.

Separate (re-)implementation of BERT such that it can be used with TorchScript's script() method (not just trace). This allows for better/more reliable handling of internal model logic and removes the requirement for fixed input size, resulting in large speedups when average input size is << than max input size.

Tests duplicate all the ones on the original BERT model, with the only fundamental difference being the test_torchscript* tests, which now use script() rather than trace().

This PR fixes issue #5571. 

Pre-trained tokenizers might wrap tokens around custom types (e.g. `AddedToken` from **🤗/tokenizers**) which makes (de)serialization without additional meta information difficult. This PR uses `jsonpickle` library which particularly solves  objects (de)serialization problem.

A little drawback of this approach is that type information is a subject of change and such changes will break back-compatibility once happened. But this seems just like an agreement for making careful back-compatible changes.",mozharovsky,6762769

Passed:
- `make test`
- `make style`
- `make quality`

Modifies:
- trainer.py: fixes issue
- test_trainer.py: calls `Trainer.train()`

It fixes only the case where the TRAINING dataset has not the `__len__` method.

The distinction is not between `Dataset` and `IterableDataset`, but between objects that are instances of class where `__len__` is implemented or not. This is pointed in [pytorch source](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/_modules/torch/utils/data/dataset.html#Dataset), implementation of `__len__` is up to the user.
The test is therefore: `isinstance(dataset, collections.Sized)`

NB: fixing for EVAL and TEST dataset will require more code refactor: all get funneled to `Trainer._prediction_loop()` without keeping track of whether it is EVAL or TEST, which makes the usage of `TrainingArguments.eval_steps` impossible to assume. (not to mention, there is no `test_steps` field in `TrainingArguments`)

Not all datasets have an implementation of `__len__` method, therefore the trainer should not assume it is available.

The use case is:
- Dataset with `__len__`: use `num_train_epochs` or `max_steps` to specify how long should training run
- Dataset without `__len__`: use only `max_steps`

The limitation is still valid on the EVAL / TEST dataset who still has to implement `__len__`",j-rossi-nl,48321582

- First, I investigated issue #4906 as I was having the same issue. This is due to a dependency on this [commit](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/commit/96989a2a114de9b77e7dd9495d62c4a8a549b40d) from the ONNX team available from version 1.5.0 of PyTorch, I therefore added it to the extra requirements and added to the messages to make it more obvious (along with keras2onnx for TF)
- The bigger part of this PR aims to remove the dependency of the script for specific pipelines. I believe this dependency is not needed as a conversion to ONNX simply requires a model, and a tokenizer. There are a few advantages to doing it this way:
1. This would solve #4788, and help greatly towards #5075. With this update, the conversion to ONNX no longer requires a given pipeline, and therefore any model can be converted (I have tested for instance with T5)
2. It is maybe clearer since the elements of the pipeline are not exported onto ONNX.
Let me know your thoughts on that one.
- I added some fast-running integration testing of the script to the existing tests.
- I made the onnx export compatible with the ModelOutput refactor (I believe previously it wasn't?)

A question I have is whether I should add a message or add the possibility for the user to provide a pipeline even if it is not used in order to make it back-compatible?",abelriboulot,34995848

Pros:

- Model agnostic, only a few lines to add to models to be able to use this functionality
- Reinforces the model layer API, adding `get_layers()` (name to be discussed) alongside `get_input_embeddings()` and `get_output_embeddings()`

Cons:

- The checkpoint API can only handle positional arguments, pytorch tensors or None only. This means that:
    - The `output_hidden_states` must be cast to a tensor in the model
    - Models that pass keyword arguments to their layers need to pass positional arguments (see GPT-2 for example, which uses keyword arguments [here](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/b45e65efa0fbff2611ddd68e14fa75cacef3fe08/src/transformers/modeling_gpt2.py#L488-L493)).

**Changes**

Two changes are made:

- In `preprocess.py`, `subword_len_counter` is set to `current_subwords_len` when a blank line is inserted to split up sequences that exceed the maximum sequence length.
- `tokenizer.num_added_tokens()` is subtracted from `max_len` to account for the additional tokens inserted by the BERT tokenizer.

- We want to trace the log probabilities of tokens generated during generation, so that we can do policy gradient methods (e.g we want to improve ROUGE scores for summarization by using RL).

- This requires keeping track of the computation graph as well as the log probs.

- We remove the @torch.no_grad() decorator on the `generate` method in `modeling_utils.py`. We replace this with `torch.set_grad_enabled(False)` by default. At the end of the function, we do `torch.set_grad_enabled(True), to restore the original state.

- We use `torch.distributions.Categorical` to sample from the softmax. We can call `dist.sample()` and Torch will keep the gradients.

- We modify `top_k_top_p_filtering` slightly by adding `with torch.no_grad()` for parts of the code which unnecessarily trace the gradient.

## Tests

I have run the tests not including the slow ones and they all passed.

## Example:

```
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained('distilgpt2')
model = AutoModelWithLMHead.from_pretrained('distilgpt2')   

outputs = model.generate(max_length=40, 
do_sample=True,

num_beams=1, 
num_return_sequences=3

tokens, log_probs = outputs
print(log_probs)
print(log_probs.shape)
print(tokens.shape)
```

Previously, the function took in an input_ids argument which had different behaviors in the seq2seq and language model settings: in language modeling, input_ids could be used to provide a prefix for the generation, while in seq2seq, input_ids represented the encoder input and the generation prefix was automatically initialized to a batch with one time step willed with the [BOS] token.

Conceptually, this feels a little awkward, as a language model and the decoder of a seq2seq model should really behave similarly (the latter just has added conditioning). And more importantly, there was no way to provide both the encoder input_ids and a generation prefix in the seq2seq model.

I've added a prefix_ids argument to fix that. The model will still default to using input_ids as a prefix in the language model setting so as not to break current use cases, but otherwise the model works with prefix_ids and initializes it similarly for the LM and seq2seq settings.

The second smaller change is the initialization of the past variable in generate_beam_search and generate_no_beam_search: it is now initialized to the form it will have in later generation steps, so we can dispense with the firs step tests in the prepare_inputs_for_generation functions in modeling_t5.py and modeling_bart.py

See https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/37541 which makes this necessary: if we set `l.trainable = False` on a layer _after_ initializing it, then training and serialization proceeds without apparent problems but then deserialization will fail, because:

* the `trainable` attribute doesn't get persisted
* parameter values are deserialized and batch-assigned to model parameters _in order_ — with the implicit assumption that the ordering of parameters is the same as in the model before serialization
* that assumption doesn't hold if some layers were not trainable before serialization, because the ordering of parameters depends on the `trainable` attribute, which is `True` by default because it wasn't persisted",gthb,153580

This small optimization reduces invocation run-time from 6s down to 1.1s for a single example inference where the len(examples) == 1. This optimization singular but it should be echoed across all pipelines in the Transformers repo.

ps: I also see a lot of lists with appends across the Transformers repository as a whole. This is a big speed suck. Look into using collections.deques more - deques are like lists but are highly optimized for appends.

I have written a `pyproject.toml` so your project can be setup using [poetry](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry) .

That way requirements versions can easily be tracked for people wanting to use **poetry** (it is optional).

```bash
# first setup your virtual environment, then:
pip install poetry
poetry install  # this is equivalent to 'pip install .' but with versions tracked
poetry install --extras testing # pip install -e "".[testing]""
poetry install --extras examples # pip install -r examples/requirements.txt
poetry install --extras torch  # pip install -e "".[torch]""
poetry install --extras tf  # pip install -e "".[tf]""

# edit: updating dependencies to the latest possible:
poetry update

# adding new dependencies
poetry add MyPyModule

The code set `pad_token_label_id = 0`, and increase the total number of labels `num_labels = len(labels) + 1`, but made no change to the label list. Thus the first label in label list has the same index as pad_token_label_id.

Following instructions in README take GermEval 2014 as an example, for one sentence in test dataset the token `Aachen` is labeled as `B-LOC` (`B-LOC` is the first label in label list), yet because of the collision with pad_token_label_id, both pad tokens and `Aachen` are encoded as 0:

And the test_predictions.txt is also off by one:
```
1951 I-PERpart
bis I-PERpart
1953 I-PERpart

The fix adds a placeholder label `[PAD]` at position 0 when loading the datasets and all labels positions are shifted by 1. The resulting encoding for the same sample sentence:

## Quick estimations

@LysandreJik compared memory usage with @minimaxir GPT2-simple (https://github.com/minimaxir/gpt-2-simple):

*Small model*, batch size 4, sequence length 512 (roughly similar):
- us => 9.9GB,
- GPT2-simple => 8.5GB

Increasing to a 1024 length:
- us => 20.4GB...,
- GPT2-simple => still 8.5GB

*Medium model*, batch size de 4, sequence length de 512
- us => 23.36GB. OOM on a titan with 1024 seq len.
- GPT2-simple throws an error related to layers not contained in the checkpoint

## Possible reason

Investigating our `run_lm_finetuning` script and GPT2 model showed that we are alway computing/storing cached hidden-states (which are normally only useful for decoding).

This PR attempt to fix this most probable source of large memory usage.
It cleans up a little bit GPT2 codebase at the same time.

I haven't tried it yet on a large scale test.

Recently we released our Spanish Bert Model (https://github.com/dccuchile/beto) and we found problems with the tokenization for Spanish.
The problem relates to that the basic tokenizer convert the text to NFD.

For example:

```
text = ""[CLS] compañera [SEP]""
tokenized_text = tokenizer.tokenize(text)
tokenized_text
['[CLS]', 'compa', '##ner', '##a', '[SEP]']
```

It changes *ñ* to *n*.

Another:

```
text = ""[CLS] acción [SEP]""
tokenized_text = tokenizer.tokenize(text)
tokenized_text
['[CLS]',  'accion' ,'[SEP]']
```

It changes *ó* to *o*.

That behavior is not wanted for our Spanish model so in this PR I'm adding a flag to control that.

Please review.


For Masked LM fine-tuning, I think both the original BERT and RoBERTa implementations uniformly sample x number of tokens in *each* sequence for masking (where x = mlm_probability * 100 * sequence_length)
However, The current logic in run_lm_finetuning.py does an indepdendent sampling (from bernoulli distribution) for each token in the sequence. This leads to variance in the number of masked tokens (with the average number still close to x%).

The below example illustrates an extreme case, of the current logic, where no token in the input sequence is masked.

   ...: import torch
   ...: from transformers import BertTokenizer

   ...: mlm_probability = 0.15

Because it uses `text.split(tok)`, it may accidentally split a token in the pretrained vocabulary at the middle.

For example a new token ""ht"" is added to the vocabulary. Then ""light"" will be split into `[""lig"", """"]`. But as ""light"" is a token in the pretrained vocabulary, it probably should be left intact to be processed by `self._tokenize()`.

Hence in this pull request, `text.split()` is replaced with `re.split()`, which will split only at word boundaries (`[^A-Za-z0-9_]` in regular expression). This behavior can be enabled by specifying a new `tokenize()` argument: `additional_tokens_as_full_words_only=True` (default: False). If it's specified in `tokenizer.encode(text, ...)`, it will still take effect, as this argument will be passed down to `tokenize()`.

On languages that have no or different word boundaries as above (such as Chinese or Japanese), this behavior may produce undesirable results, and the user can revert to the old `text.split()` by not specifying `additional_tokens_as_full_words_only` (it will take the default value `False`).

An explanation of the argument `additional_tokens_as_full_words_only` has been added to the docstring of `tokenize()`. A test function `test_add_partial_tokens_tokenizer()` has been added to `tokenization_bert_test.py`.

- All ${TokenizerName}Vocab dataclass provide a from_pretrained method in charge of reading necessary files 
- All tokenizer now take as first argument vocabs which has to ${TokenizerName}Vocab instance. 
- All model now have a static member vocab_class which points to the desired ${TokenizerName}Vocab data class 

- Some ${TokenizerName}Vocab.from_pretrained share loading routines and thus code is currently duplicated across all of them. It might be possible to refactor to use a generic method that handles such loading.

Actually, their model(Roberta) didn't use `segment_embeddings` because they found the effectiveness of `FULL/DOC SENTENCE` setting of inputs.

In the Bitbucket test suite, we use a [similar library](https://bitbucket.org/bitbucket/fakedata) (to faker) to generate the fake data. At the time I wrote that library, I wasn't aware of faker. One feature of that library I really find useful is its ability to optionally obfuscate strings. So the library can generate strings like ""ợɼȧɳɠé"", which are quite readable.

I thought it would be cool to add such a feature to faker and then move our test suite to faker (and deprecate fakedata). I'm not sure if you would be open to integrating my changes, given that this is an esoteric feature, but I'd appreciate it if you did.

## Are there changes in behavior for the user?

<!-- Outline any notable behaviour for the end users. -->

This makes development faster in some cases.
E.g. when you want to run only one test case or one test module quickly to check your changes in the code or in the test itself and don't want to run all tests after each little change it's more convenient and fast to run only the test case/module you're interested in.

Summary:

- Fixed unnecessary use of None
- Fixed the use of hasattr
- Fixed dangerous default argument
- Fixed unnecessary use of comprehension
- Removed object inheritance and super delegation
- Add .deepsource.toml

I ran a DeepSource Analysis on my fork of this repository. You can see all the issues raised by DeepSource [here](https://deepsource.io/gh/HarshCasper/dirsearch/).

DeepSource helps you to automatically find and fix issues in your code during code reviews. This tool looks for anti-patterns, bug risks, performance problems, and raises issues. There are plenty of other issues in relation to Bug Discovery and Anti-Patterns which you would be interested to take a look at.

If you do not want to use DeepSource to continuously analyze this repo, I'll remove the `.deepsource.toml` from this PR and you can merge the rest of the fixes. If you want to setup DeepSource for Continuous Analysis, I can help you set that up.",HarshCasper,47351025

This detecting Python is certain to cause camke to skip using manually configured Python-related Settings and go directly to the default Python environment. A simple example, using miniconda to build Python environment, base environment Python version is 3.10, opencv_py environment Python version is 3.8, although cmake is configured with opencv_py as the Python environment used in the compilation, However, the cmake configuration will still point to Python in the base environment.

Currently, OpenCV's build_sdk.py script always chooses c++_shared (or gnustl_static for older NDK versions).

This PR adds a flag, `--stl`, which allows the user to select a different STL. This is useful if you want to build OpenCV as a static library, or if you want to integrate the OpenCV library with other code that's using a different STL, since you're only supposed to use one STL for all native libraries of an app.

I targeted the 3.4 branch since it seemed like a small improvement which is still backwards-compatible, but I can rebase it against master if you want, just let me know!

### This pullrequest changes

Increase CV_IO_MAX_IMAGE_PIXELS to 2^40 since apparently #11505 fixes #10211. I have no idea what this change breaks, but I assume all tests passed because no one is testing huge images. So if this max is increased then big images need to be tested. 
While we're at it maybe CV_IO_MAX_IMAGE_WIDTH and CV_IO_MAX_IMAGE_HEIGHT should be increased too. 

I tried reading in a 50000x50000 PNG file and running simple operations: saving, GaussianBlur, boxFilter, Laplacian. I could not load a 100000x100000 PNG without running out of memory.

Perhaps a warning can be issued to users if they try loading images bigger than 2^30 (previous limit). I know Pillow errors but this error can be turned into a warning or suppressed without recompiling.

The level of structure of GPU is defined hierarchically.

From small to large, the computation units are:
**invocation** < **thread** < **block** < **grid**.

- **invocation**:
  Invocation is the **body of a for-loop**.
  Each invocation corresponding to a specific ``i`` value in for-loop.

- **thread**:
  Invocations are grouped into threads.
  Threads are the minimal unit that is parallelized.
  All invocations within a thread are executed in **serial**.
  We usually use 1 invocation per thread for maximizing parallel performance.

- **block**:
  Threads are grouped into blocks.
  All threads within a block are executed in **parallel**.
  Threads within the same block can share their **block local storage**.

- **grid**:
  Blocks are grouped into grids.
  Grid is the minimal unit that being **launched** from host.
  All blocks within a grid are executed in **parallel**.
  In Taichi, each **parallelized for-loop** is a grid.",archibate,20640597

## Description
Makes sure Luigi waits for kubernetes to scale up when waiting for a job run.


## Motivation and Context
Sometimes scheduling a new job results in the cluster needing to scale up. 
In these scenarios current luigi throws an exception which exits the pipeline. In the meantime the cluster runs the job after scaling up.
Changes introduced in this PR makes it so that Luigi waits for Scale up to take place when waiting for a job to run.

My attempt to address issue of toml usage error in S3Client from https://github.com/spotify/luigi/pull/2996

<!--- Describe your changes -->
I'm providing two solutions to choose from, one to fill lacking functions into LuigiTomlParser and another to change the usage into more generic one. While I prefer the second one, when the reviewers prefer one over another, I'll add tests for it.

LuigiConfigParser is built on top of Python's ConfigParser, which is MutableMapping at the end.
LuigiTomlParser is using toml (the module), and it does not provide a comparable class but rather provide load/dump via decoder/encoder.
They work a bit differently. A touch to BaseParser may be needed on a long term because there may be other issues due to differences in their functionalities (not being addressed in this PR).

## Motivation and Context

<!--- If it fixes an open issue, please link to the issue here. -->
Resolves error on S3Client when attempting to use toml. It would give this before:
```
defaults = dict(configuration.get_config().defaults())
AttributeError: 'LuigiTomlParser' object has no attribute 'defaults'

I ran my jobs with this code and it works for me.

I'm happy to add tests when one solution is preferred over another by the reviewers.

While loading data into mongodb, it was known that the write method of luigi's mongodb module could only be used if object_id existed.
But I just wanted to insert the dictionary data as it is.
The existing write method is rather more appropriate with the name 'update'. Thus, the write method was modified to update method and replaced the write with insert.

I tested it and it works fine. However, when using the write method, empty values must be added to the document_id and path parameters.

731387082,Fix blocking worker queue when scheduling in parallel,3013,3997010,spotify/luigi,['wontfix'],open,8,2020-10-28T12:12:57Z,2022-01-09T01:13:48Z,,"Hi,

this PR is meant to fix* and improve the parallel scheduling of tasks. To demonstrate what is currently failing (* therefore the fix), I added the WIP label and only added one commit with a simple test that currently, against my expectation, does not pass but blocks the entire process.


## Description

The blocking occurs when parallel scheduling is enabled but a task is not picklable. The scheduling is mostly implemented in `Worker.add`,

https://github.com/spotify/luigi/blob/cf2abbdb998f9e0d72801b8c8e9b2f8cfc16b7a1/luigi/worker.py#L730-L774

where processes of a pool put the results of task completeness checks back into a queue. However, when the task is not picklable, the queue is never filled so that `queue.get()` will block forever without being able to access exceptions raised in the process. Instead, the exception is hold by the [`AsyncResult`](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/multiprocessing.html#multiprocessing.pool.AsyncResult) object returned by `apply_async` which is not used in `Worker.add`, so there is currently no handle to catch these cases.


## Possible solution

IMHO, the root cause for this issue is the difference between the actual [`multiprocessing.Pool.apply_async`](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/multiprocessing.html#multiprocessing.pool.Pool.apply_async) (returning an async result object) and the custom [`SingleProcessPool.apply_async`](https://github.com/spotify/luigi/blob/cf2abbdb998f9e0d72801b8c8e9b2f8cfc16b7a1/luigi/worker.py#L352) (instantly returning the result of the function call). The latter should produce something like a `SyncResult` with the same API as `AsyncResult`. Following this, one should rely on its built-in functionality to wrap exceptions (re-raised when calling `get()`) and a lot of the custom exception handling in worker.py would be obsolete (such as [`AsyncCompletionException`](https://github.com/spotify/luigi/blob/cf2abbdb998f9e0d72801b8c8e9b2f8cfc16b7a1/luigi/worker.py#L377) and [`TracebackWrapper`](https://github.com/spotify/luigi/blob/cf2abbdb998f9e0d72801b8c8e9b2f8cfc16b7a1/luigi/worker.py#L386)) which simplifies  things quite a lot.

I already implemented this (all tests pass) and will push it if you agree :)

I know that you guys are (understandably) very cautious when it comes to changes in core code, but I think the parallel scheduling could really benefit from this change / fix.


## Motivation and Context

Our dependency trees sometimes take O(h) to build as our completeness checks require a lot of remote resources. Therefore, we make heavy use of the parallel scheduling feature.  Besides this issue/PR, we plan to submit two additional PRs in the future:

- We noticed that a list of tasks started with [`interface.build(many_tasks_in_a_list, ...)`](https://github.com/spotify/luigi/blob/cf2abbdb998f9e0d72801b8c8e9b2f8cfc16b7a1/luigi/interface.py#L214) is not using the parallel scheduling at all (because of [this loop](https://github.com/spotify/luigi/blob/cf2abbdb998f9e0d72801b8c8e9b2f8cfc16b7a1/luigi/interface.py#L170)).
- We would like to start running tasks already *while* the dependency tree is being built. Most of the required functionality is actually already there and would need only minor additions.


## Have you tested this? If so, how?

Yes, the test is included and will pass once the parallel scheduling is fixed.",riga,1908734

## Description
1. Changes related to bytes-like object handling instead of string type.
2. Changes in order to support older versions of LSF.

The changes described were made in order to run the LSF modules correctly. Without these changes, I experienced several errors using Python 3.6.

## Motivation and Context
I have made some changes to the LSF modules (lsf.py and lsf_runner.py). 

1. Changes due to the following error: TypeError: a bytes-like object is required, not 'str'
I changed the way the pickle files are handled, they should be opened in binary mode, pickle data is explicitly defined as binary: 
""The pickle module implements binary protocols for serializing and de-serializing a Python object structure. “Pickling” is the process whereby a Python object hierarchy is converted into a byte stream, and “unpickling” is the inverse operation, whereby a byte stream (from a binary file or bytes-like object) is converted back into an object hierarchy.""
Due to this change, some data had to be changed from string type to a bytes-like object.
In addition, subprocess returns bytes objects for stdout stream, I made some changes in lsf.py module because in some parts of the code this stdout was taken as string type or was parsed incorrectly.
2. Changes due to problems with older versions of LSF
In LSF 9.1.1.1, the -noheader and -o options are added to the bjobs command; therefore, I made some changes to the track_job function (lsf.py) in order to support previous LSF versions.

This PR refactors the Postgres-related contribution tasks to use context managers and increases the number of `try`-`finally` blocks. By this, we can increase their robustness. Plus, using these constructs is simply a proven idiom.

Note that the overall failure potential is quite high in this place because first of all, `CopyToTable` is an abstract class that provides several hooks for subclasses. If any subclass raises an error in such a hook, connections must be rolled back and cursors be released. At the moment, you are likely to receive tons of ""database is already in use"" failures as soon as a single task fails.

Further information on robust connection programming can be found on the [Psycopg2 documentation site](https://www.psycopg.org/docs/usage.html#with-statement).

## Have you tested this? If so, how?
Not explicitly tested, but I did not add any new features.

Provided that no existing tests will be broken, is it necessary to test such a refactoring?

(If required, it might be an option to create subclasses of the tasks that provoke errors.)

To extend the usability of Luigi UI, added the ability to read the CronJobs
from Kubernetes cluster in a specific namespace and the ability to run the
CronJobs manually from Luigi UI.

## Motivation and Context
The Luigi UI is limited and does not have the ability to list and run jobs as in other scheduling tools. As a starting point, added interaction with Kubernetes API that can list the CronJobs in a Kubernetes cluster (which most probably will be scheduled jobs that uses Luigi) and add the ability to run those jobs manually. This reduces the overhead of authorization of the Kubernetes cluster, hopping to the CronJobs page and triggering the job manually.

Smoke-tested in Python 2 (with configparser installed) and Python 3. I successfully ran luigi with a config file containing ""%%"" in both Python 2 and Python 3. I don't have a formal test for my specific use case yet (I think it reduces to proving that configparser is imported when available in Python 2), but I'm happy to add a test for this if needed.

Gives a second option to using an in-memory dict as the state store, instead allowing `_state` to point to a SQL DB. Also adds various `persist_task()` calls in places where we were quietly modifying a task that lived in the state, outside of the state, which is leaky and led to a number of bugs with this at the start.

In the process, factored out the state storage into a separate file with an abstract interface and some default implementations, in case someone else wants to add a new state store someday, the API is now substantially smaller/cleaner.

Note, this performs remarkably badly as-is, since Luigi hasn't been written in a way to minimize requests to the state store -- I've made a few necessary changes to this (caching, etc) already and will put all those in a second PR.

This is a big change and of course will require revision before becoming merge-able, but, do you all see any immediate problems with the approach?

Will squash before merging (if y'all like the PR)

## Motivation and Context
Once Luigi (at our company, at least) hits a few thousand tasks, the state's `dump()` method starts to become very flaky, with `pickle` failing to serialize the whole state sometimes and thus we lose all the tasks. These tasks are pretty valuable and it's a setback to lose them, so this is an attempt to keep them in a, uh, less-perishable place, immune to restarts and crashes.

Not sure if there's an open issue for this.

## Have you tested this? If so, how?
Sadly this one is just ""I ran all our jobs with this and it works"", I didn't see any unit tests for the state storage to begin with and this would need some kind of SQL testing setup that I don't know much about :\

I've added a JSON config parser analogous to the TOML one.

## Motivation and Context

JSON is a nice format to write config files. We needed lists/arrays, so INI was not an option and found the TOML tooling quite unpleasant to use (i.e. fmt-toml, TOML VSCode extension).

## Have you tested this? If so, how?
I have included unit tests and I ran my jobs with this code and it works for me.

If this gets merged, maybe you guys can add a note to the luigi docs, so people know how to use it (add a luigi.json file and set LUIGI_CONFIG_PARSER=json). A sample config can be found in the tests directory.

  - Use the container reason from the Batch job attempt if the statusReason is `Task failed to start`
  - Use the most recent attempt when evaluating errors

## Motivation and Context
<!--- Why is this change required? What problem does it solve? -->

If a Batch job fails to start (due to an invalid task definition for example) no log group is created for that task so the actual Exception raised by the BatchClient is 

```
ResourceNotFoundException
An error occurred (ResourceNotFoundException) when calling the GetLogEvents operation: The specified log stream does not exist.
```

This change fixes it so that if the task has failed to start the reason from the container is used instead. This makes the actual Exception raised by the Batch client:

```
BatchJobException
Job [REDACTED] failed: CannotPullContainerError: Error response from daemon: manifest for [REDACTED] not found
````

Additionally the Batch client was only looking at the first container attempt. This change uses the latest container attempt in any status reason or log gathering.

Change `task.flatten` function to stop recursion when a `Task` or `Target` instance is found.

## Motivation and Context
It allows for `Task` or `Target` to implement `__getitem__` or `__iter__`. I'd like to use this to present a simpler interface for subclasses of `Target`s or `WrappedTask`s. The latter I sometimes use as `subtasks` in downstream `Task`s.

This function is used to create a flat list of `Task`s or `Target`s (depending where it's used) from a structured input of `Task`s or `Target`s.
Currently, it has a section when it tries to convert the input to an iterator, that would yield either `Task`s, `Target`s or another structured input. If a subclass of `Task` or `Target` implements `__getitem__` or `__iter__`, it gets iterated and its items (which wouldn't be `Task`s or `Target`s, in my case) flattened.

## Have you tested this? If so, how?
I did a simple test by checking that `Task._requires()` outputted the same list of `Tasks`,
and checked for uses of flatten in the codebase, which is always used to get a flat list of `Task`s or `Target`s.",maurosilber,9124827

`_obj_exists` lists all the objects with given prefix, so in case if you have those objects in your bucket:
```
gs://bucket/dir/obj1

And you ask if `gs://bucket/dir/` exists it'll return `True` while no `gs://bucket/dir/` object is present. This broke `mkdir` method, as it would not create directory object if some contents already had been present inside of it.

This fixes that behaviour checking if literal path is present in the list.

## Description
Adds a `process_requires` method to `Task` class. Similar to `_requires` and `process_resources`, this allows a Template task to inspect and modify dependencies before passing them to Luigi worker.

This is different from `_requires` or `deps` in that this works with dynamic dependencies yielded from `run` as well.

We have a template task that needed to pass some parameters along the dependency tree. This change could be used to obviate the need for using `clone` in every Task:
```

This will add a first version of the Snowflake contrib as we currently use it. The only functionality it has is to copy data from S3. It doesn't support other actions that the PSQL or Redshift integration would.

I feel like we should this contribute this to the community and the community could add their own functionality as needed.

We're currently investigating migrating from Redshift to Snowflake and to our surprise there was no Snowflake integration in Luigi. Since we still needed it, we've decided to build our own following our simple use case which is to load data from S3 into Snowflake.

## Have you tested this? If so, how?
This is currently running in our staging environment and tested through unit tests. The unit tests could be better as there are some edge cases that aren't tested, but Redshift and PSQL integrations suffer from the same problem.

This PR adds another functionality to the `inherits` and `requires` decorator functions. The additional keyword arguments given during the call to `@inherits` (or `@requires`) will override the parameters in the base class, like when calling `self.clone(Task, **kwargs)` with the difference, that those overridden parameters will not be propagated to the inheriting class.

The changes in this PR allow to write something like

```python
class TaskA(luigi.Task):
    param_a1 = luigi.IntParameter()
    param_a2 = luigi.IntParameter()

@requires(TaskA, param_a1=3)
class TaskB(luigi.Task):
    param_b = luigi.IntParameter()
```
which defines a task `TaskB`, which does not have a parameter called `param_a1` (but still one with `param_a2` and `param_b`), but requires `TaskA` with `param_a1` set to 3 already.

This is especially useful if one wants to define a standard set of tasks, where a specific option is already known.

Additionally, I have refactored the `@requires` object a bit to inherit from the `@inherit` object (no pun intended).

## Motivation and Context
Example: you have a machine learning training and testing task. They both depend on one task to generate the data - with a parameter which data to generate. The training task will always require `Generation(training=True)` whereas the testing task will require `Generation(training=False)`. The new `@requires` call simplifies this.

Add a check for default in `Parameter._warn_on_wrong_param_type` before giving out warning by adding an additional if clause to skip the cases of where the parameter is default

## Motivation and Context
Currently, the parameter `task_process_context` is being passed as None for default.
However, in the `Parameter._warn_on_wrong_param_type` method, check for string is made and 
if the `param_value` is not a string, the warning is raised.
Therefore, as I was not giving any parameter input for `task_process_context`, every job that I ran displayed this warning, and I thought it would be a good idea to check for default only for the `Parameter` class, to resolve this issue.

Adding `target_table` to the `exists` method of PostgresTarget checks if a specific `update_id` exists for a specific table, rather than any table.

## Motivation and Context
This way, one can use a ""general"" `update_id` (e.g. update_id = '2018-05-01', if a Pipeline has to be executed on a daily basis) for every task involved in this Pipeline.
Since a `PostgresTarget` can only point to one specific table anyway, it makes sense to constraint its `exists` method to check for an `update_id` of this specific table.

In the current implementation, every task in a Pipeline has to have a specific `update_id`. 
This often results in the table name being integrated to the `update_id` (e.g.: 'table-a-2018-05-01', 'table-b-2018-05-01', ...), which brings redundancy, since the table name is in the column `target_table` anyway.

In very large task graphs with task retry enabled (awaiting updates), the tasks which are scheduled first may never execute because by the time the newer tasks inserted into the graphs expire their re-attempt timeouts, the scheduler will decide to run them again.

Changes retcodes.run_with_retcodes() and cmdline.luigi_run() such that the exit code determined in run_with_retcodes() is returned to luigi_run(), and then returned by luigi_run() to its caller (typically the ""luigi"" script file). As a result, the ""luigi"" script should return the same values it does today, but that value is now recoverable from luigi_run() if a user has written their own invocation wrapper rather than use the provided ""luigi"" script.

The net result for luigi programs that are invoked with the ""luigi"" script should be no change, the same codes will be returned.

## Motivation and Context
<!--- Why is this change required? What problem does it solve? -->
<!--- If it fixes an open issue, please link to the issue here. -->
I'm currently working on several large (thousands of tasks) luigi-based workflows which need to perform setup (teardown) steps before (after) luigi runs their tasks. The need for setup code means I can't make use of the ""luigi"" script, and because the current implementation of run_with_retcodes calls sys.exit() directly, running teardown code is difficult, and mapping luigi's return codes to a set of return codes that work for me and my calling environment is very-difficult-bordering-on-impossible.

Also, calling sys.exit() from multiple locations deep in the call stack is, I believe, not generally regarded as a good practice.

I've been running one large job with this change applied to luigi 2.7.1 and haven't had any issues.

The flake8 and py27-nonhdfs tox suites fail, but they also fail on master, so I don't know what to make of that. I ran test/cmdline_test.py by itself and it runs the same (18 failed, 15 passed) as before my change, but it's worth noting that while several tests in that file check for a return code of 0, none check for return codes other than 0.

<img width=""1366"" alt=""test_cencored"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2675621/35200213-f57ef9f4-fed7-11e7-9bde-2ac52a19e351.png"">

## Motivation and Context
In many cases, it is useful to render your task graph as a diagram - for documentation or presentation purposes. staticviz does exactly that - you can render your graphs on the fly (to README.md, for example), apply fancy styles for the presentations - or store it as an `svg`  and hand out to a professional designer.

#2202 
Similar to how `luigi.contrib.dataproc` adds support for remote Spark job execution via GCP; and 'luigi.contrib.kubernetes` supports remote jobs configured over API calls.  

I would still like to add unit tests and an example before merge, but would like an initial round of feedback before going much further. 

In particular, I am wondering if there is a better way to handle tracking of clusters when running Create/Delete. For GCP, it is easy to track as the cluster name is expected to be a unique identifier; in Databricks, the cluster name is not required to be unique - it's not even required at all (i.e., you can create a cluster with """" as the name). Instead, a new `cluster_id` parameter is returned from the initial create cluster API call, and that is used as reference. 

Right now I'm essentially requiring a user-defined `signal_complete()` method which writes out the `cluster_id` to a target; the target must be loaded in to whatever upstream task requires it. 

One alternative: treat `cluster_name` as globally-unique as far as Luigi is concerned. Then it's just a GET call to `/clusters/list`, and grab the one with a matching name and `state=='RUNNING'`. The risk is that if someone manually creates a cluster with that name in the same workspace, the task would use that cluster, which may be an ill-fit for the job.

## Description

<!--- Describe your changes -->

Changes to the luigi.contrib.ecs file:

Bug fix for when creating task definitions on a yield of an ECS task.
Default value for parameter was None, since Luigi serializes parameters it seems it becomes a string 'None'.
Which when bool-ed evaluates to True, instead of the intended False.
This leads to the ValueError (checking that one and only one parameter of task definition input was given) to be falsely raised sometimes.
To combat this I set the default value to an empty string so that the serizaled version evaulates to False.
Also the dictionary for a new task definition needed to be unserizaled so I used module ast (included with Python).

Added poll time as a param with default 2 seconds - it makes sense for longer running ECS tasks to have not so frequent requests.

Added a deregister task definition option - useful if you only need a task definition for one particular task.

## Motivation and Context

<!--- Why is this change required? What problem does it solve? -->

I am working on developing a platform where Luigi and ECS interlink - I didn't want to have to create a task in AWS Console before being able to run a container. Rather I want Luigi to dyanmically create these. I ran into problems with this, noticably the bug and the want to be able to degregister a task definition. Also I have ECS tasks that run around 24 hours - I didn't want to Luigi polling every two seconds. I modified the code for my purposes and thought I'd contribute the updates.

Examples of the bugs:

```
luigi --module luigi.contrib.ecs ECSTask --task-def-arn='test' --local-scheduler
```
works fine (up until an boto3 error which is expected)

```
luigi --module luigi.contrib.ecs ECSTask --task-def={""test"":""test""} --local-scheduler
```
or
```
luigi --module luigi.contrib.ecs ECSTask --task-def=""{'test':'test'} --local-scheduler
```
recieves a 
```
TypeError: register_task_definition() argument after ** must be a mapping, not str
```

A task designed to run Jupyter notebooks as luigi tasks that also allows to pass parameters to the notebook from outside of the notebook.

JupyterNotebookTask requires the `nbconvert` and the `nbformat` modules.

## Motivation and Context
<!--- Why is this change required? What problem does it solve? -->
<!--- If it fixes an open issue, please link to the issue here. -->
JupyterNotebookTask allows to easily integrate in a luigi pipeline code that has been written in Jupyter Notebooks.

Frequently, users write code in Jupyter notebooks and then want to stitch them together in luigi pipelines. Pipelines with notebooks are harder to write and execute because it is difficult to pass parameters from outside of the notebooks to the notebooks themselves.

JupyterNotebookTask passes parameters such as `self.input()[...].path` and `self.output().path` to the notebook, along with any additional user-defined parameters. The notebook is executed via nbconvert by the task's run method.

The run method of JupyterNotebookTask allows the user to specify a `pars` dictionary with the parameters to be passed to the notebook. Then, during the execution of the run method, the task
writes this dictionary to a temporary JSON file in the same location of the notebook. The temporary file is always named `notebook_title.ipynbpars`, where `notebook_title` is the title of the Jupyter notebook. The notebook can access the `pars` dictionary by reading the contents of the JSON file. Once the run method is executed (successfully or not), the temporary JSON file is deleted.

This tries to improvise luigi scheduler by addressing bottlenecks

## Motivation and Context

When luigi worker starts it builds a dependency graph and checks for completion of all tasks.
If we start **w** workers with **t** tasks each, we are instantly checking **(w * t)** tasks for completion which generally are `output().exists()` calls. In a typical use case **w** is expected to increase linearly with **t** so that we could parallelise efficiently. Instead, we end up with a bottleneck with O(n^2) calls.

Changing completion check to lazy addresses this.
- First worker builds the entire graph with with `PENDING` status and submits it to the scheduler
- Scheduler merges it with it's existing graph and returns with a list of tasks to complete
- Worker checks each task it receives for completion and proceeds to try and run it.
  - If task is already completed, worker informs scheduler about the same and gets next task
  - If task is not completed, worker proceeds to run it and informs the scheduler about the result(`DONE`/`FAIL`)
- Scheduler as usual makes sure only one worker is working on a task so there are no collisions even while we mark `DONE` tasks as `PENDING`

However, starting with the PENDING status for tasks results in already DONE/FAIL tasks to be (wrongly) transitioned to PENDING when a new worker starts and submits it's graph. Hence a `NEW` task state is introduced. Which is a pseudo state and replaced by scheduler to existing task state or `PENDING` as appropriate. This change makes the workers run tasks correctly. 

One final issue remaining is that now the task status is not synchronised between worker and scheduler and as a result the execution summary is off. We remedy this by returning the modified task status(and other info) from scheduler to worker and updating the worker's copy of the task.

231725063,Added BigQuery chunking logic for huge uploads,2136,3997010,spotify/luigi,['wontfix'],closed,3,2017-05-26T20:16:28Z,2018-08-14T02:20:16Z,2018-08-14T02:20:16Z,"## Motivation and Context
Some people are uploading huge amounts of data (15+ TB) and they are hitting BQ Timeouts. The easiest solution is to chunk data and upload partially.

## Description
We added two new Luigi Parameters:
 - Boolean `chunking-enabled` - when True (default is False) it will chunk your source data and upload synchronously with a default chunk size (1 TB)
- Int `chunk-size-gb` - user can adjust (optionally) chunk size 

If chunking is disabled, then the upload logic is not changed. If chunking is enabled, we will upload chunks to separated temp tables, then we will atomically merge them and store result in one final table. All the temp tables are removed after successful run.

We have a heuristic calculating the size of the input data to be chunked, so chunk size can vary. We are also assuming that files within a a folder to be chunked are of a similar size. So we can handle let's say 22000 files 90MB each or 500 files 17GB each. 

## Have you tested this? If so, how?
We have included unit tests and did some stress and manual tests in house.

Allow a the default to be specified for a `Parameter` as a `default_callable`. The callable will be executed and the value locked in when a task is initialized, but initializing another task could yield a different value.

## Motivation and Context
Prior to this change, default parameter values are only evaluated when a task class is initially loaded. For defaults such as `datetime.datetime.utcnow()`, this might not always provide the desired flexibility, since running the task again would result in the same datetime value.

In our case, this is a problem because we trigger tasks in a loop with `luigi.build()`, but often find ourselves duplicating parameter `default` definitions in our executor script so we can recalculate it every time and match the behavior of running on the command line. It would be nice to avoid the duplication.

I imagine there may also be cases where a long running worker wouldn't want to be stuck with the same default value.

This is an initial pass at adding metric collection functionality to the Central Scheduler, and is still a work in progress. I'm looking for feedback on the general approach.

Summary of changes:

- Dummy `MetricsCollector` class (luigi/metrics.py) with no-op methods, but can be subclassed for a specific metric collection tool.
- `PrometheusMetricsCollector` class (luigi/contrib/prometheus.py) that subclasses the above, as an example implementation.
- New `scheduler` config option/parameter to select the metric collection tool.
- changes to `SimpleTaskState` to identify and trigger metric updates.
- Added `Scheduler.remove_worker` rpc_method to related `Worker._remove_worker` method to allow workers to tell the scheduler when they are finishing and disconnecting. This allows us to distinguish between deliberate disconnects and worker failures.

Catch `botocore.exceptions.BotoCoreError`s (e.g. `NoCredentialsError`, `NoRegionError`) when trying to send error email notifications using AWS SES.

Problem and solution identified thanks to #1821, which solves a similar issue for SMTP.

## Motivation and Context

When a task has been retried too many times and should be set as `DISABLED`, luigi tries to send an error email (at [scheduler.py:539](https://github.com/spotify/luigi/blob/master/luigi/scheduler.py#L539)), in this case using AWS SES. If boto3 fails to find AWS credentials (e.g. AWS `region`), then it raises an exception (e.g. `NoRegionError`) in the call to `notifications.send_error_email`. Afterwards, luigi complains that

    luigi-interface ERROR    Failed connecting to remote scheduler 'http://localhost:8082'
    ...
    urllib.error.HTTPError: HTTP Error 500: Internal Server Error

and when trying to run the task again, the following is logged in `luigi-server.log`:

    tornado.application[22] ERROR: Uncaught exception POST /api/get_work (::1)

    HTTPServerRequest(protocol='http', host='localhost:8082', method='POST', uri='/api/get_work', version='HTTP/1.1', remote_ip='::1', headers={'Accept-Encoding': 'identity', 'Host': 'localhost:8082', 'Connection': 'close', 'User-Agent': 'Python-urllib/3.4', 'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded', 'Content-Length': '251'})

Added to S3FlagTarget the ability to read a set of underlying partition files as though they were a single file. 

The code has been written to be fairly generic, so it has been added as a separate module. It should theoretically have nearly drop-in suitability with other ""Flag"" Targets such as the GCS Flag Target. However, I am unable to test other systems, and so have not inserted the proper shims into contrib/gcs or any other parts of Luigi.
## Motivation and Context

Though it is generally advisable to refrain from dealing with any Hadoop-style distributed data in a serial manner, it is nevertheless occasionally necessary to combine data at the end of a workflow into a single file suitable for use in serial systems.

In my own case, I find it necessary to combine the results of a Spark CSV write into a single Spark file for upload to an external service. It would sometimes be possible to have Spark coalesce the data into a single partition before writing, but in cases where the data is very large, this might be prohibitive or even impossible depending on available memory.

The more general solution to this problem is the ability to have Luigi read multiple ""partition"" files in sequence, as though they were a single file target. The data from the partition files can then be streamed through memory in small amounts as they are written elsewhere - in my case, to the external service.

I also recognize that sometimes certain types of files cannot be correctly concatenated so simply. In my example, a CSV file with a header defining the column names, there is a single header line per partition file, but this is not suitable for the external service. Therefore, the PartitionedFilesReader allows callable functions to be submitted at creation time that will allow a savvy user to selectively modify or ignore parts of the files as they are being read, while still providing a clean Luigi Target interface to the pipeline.
## Have you tested this? If so, how?

I have tested this thoroughly with my own systems, including with the line-based and byte-based filtering function. 
I have also added a basic unit test.

Added to S3Target the ability to write temp file on S3 instead of to local file system. This requires boto3 >= 1.4.0, but is only enabled if requested by the caller, so it should not affect current users at all.
## Motivation and Context

When working with very large files, it is impractical (or impossible) to write an entire file to a local filesystem. S3 is much more scalable, and it makes more sense to write the temporary/in-progress file there instead of locally. This significantly increases the flexibility of working with S3Target for my use cases, and I imagine it will come in handy for others as well. 
## Have you tested this? If so, how?

I have tested this thoroughly with my own code and it works well. I have not included unit tests, but can write some if someone can point me to an example set of tests for the AtomicS3File. The particular issues that need to be tested in a formal test are small files vs large files. Because boto3 handles these differently (because of S3 rules about multipart upload sizes), it was necessary to write some logic to intelligently buffer to meet boto3's expectations. The file sizes to test would be files < 5MB, files < 8MB, files <16MB, and files >16MB.

This Pull Request is meant to add a compressed boolean option to AtomicLocalFile to compress data when writing to the file. This particular pull request isn't necessarily the final code, but meant to start a conversation on whether or not this is the right direction to go. One alternative is to explicitly create an AtomicCompressedLocalFile (and associated inherited classes)
## Motivation and Context

In my particular use case, I'd like to compress CSV data (using the csv module) when writing to S3 using the AtomicS3LocalFile. The method I used beforehand was to use zlib to compress data before writing the content to a file - however, it ends up being a little bulky/cumbersome if you want to use the python csv.writer. In particular, with the csv module, I would write to a stringio w/ csv.writer to format the data before then compressing the contents of the stringio when writing to the final atomic file. The usage of AtomicLocalFile with compression=True would be then be similar to using GzipFile.

This is not only unnecessary from a performance standpoint, it actually causes problems with IAM permissions. It's common for a policy to restrict `LIST` access on the bucket root but still allow read/write on some sub-path. With the way things are now, you _need_ to have read access to the root bucket even if Luigi only ever accesses a subpath, since that first validation on the bucket will fail with a 403.

With this fix, if you're calling `.exists()` on a bucket root, nothing changes, everything works as before. But if you call it on a non-root path, it will skip validation on bucket creation and only validate the key. If the bucket happens to not exist (which is what `.get_bucket(validate=True)` is meant to check for) then it will still fail on `.get_key()`. If it does exist, then we've avoided an unnecessary API call and permission issue.

The function 'luigi.util.previous' tries to create a ""previous"" task class based on the existence of a DateParameter (or one of the many variants of DateParameter).

## Motivation and Context

Updating 'luigi.util.previous' in this manner allows 'luigi.util.get_previous_completed' to work with tasks that have year or month parameters.

Task classes make great ""dataset addresses"", but when loading them in notebook-style interactive sessions (iPython, Jupyter, Zeppelin, etc) it can be burdensome to remember and specify the exact date for each particular dataset, as a datetime parameter.  Often we just want to grab the latest dataset and get on with it.  That was not easily possible for tasks with date or year parameters without this patch.

Host resources are resources used on a specific host. Tasks with host_resource
set will be limited by how many can run on the same machine, but there is no
limit to how many can run globally. For example, if you have a process that
requires 2gb of memory, you might set its host_resources to {'memory': 2} and
then set the host resource for memory on each machine according to how much it
has available. If you have a machine with 8gb of memory, you can run 4 such
tasks on it. If you have another machine with 16gb of memory, you can run
another 8 tasks on it.
## Motivation and Context

I've noticed recently that several people in the mailing list have been asking how to limit resource usage on a machine level. Existing resources are somewhat capable of this by adding a resource_name__machine_name resource, but this only works if tasks are tied to a particular machine. If you have a task that can be run on multiple machines but shouldn't have too many per machine, this solution won't do. I recently created a kind of task that can only be run one at a time per machine, but can be run in parallel across arbitrary machines, so I needed a way to enable this pattern.
## Have you tested this? If so, how?

I have included unit tests. I have not yet run jobs with it, as I don't have the machines set up to run anything nontrivial that actually requires it yet.

   def output(self):
        return luigi.LocalTarget('/tmp/{1}/{0}'.format(type(self).__name__, self.tablename))
```

`
The patch ensures the local target is touched upon successful completion of the hive session.
## Motivation and Context

<!--- Why is this change required? What problem does it solve? -->

Without the patch, HiveQueryTask with LocalTarget was not touched. There was no place to write the logic for touching the local target file.
`job.output().open(""w"").close()`
Without touching the file, the luigi session will retry the task and then eventually error out because the target was not written and it is assumed the task was not complete.

This will make all affected functions consistently return size-() arrays for scalar inputs, which is a slight API change but actually more consistent that the previous situation (multinomial would return a size-() array for valid scalar inputs and a plain scalar for invalid inputs; hypergeom would always return a plain scalar for scalar inputs).

This PR reviews the tests of recent bug fixes in ``linprog(method='simplex')``. 

Further the PR alters the error checking such that the ``status=4`` (numerical difficulties encountered) instead of raising a `ValueError` when ``status == 2 and is_feasible``. The choice of status is ambiguous and I'd like someone with a little more experience to consider how to handle it (@mdhaber @ilayn @rgommers)

Phase one of the simplex method fails to find the basic feasible solution if the pseudo-objective function is very slightly greater than `tol`, this isn't really a bug but an issue with the default tolerance (see: #8958). During the conversion back to the original problem via ``_post_solve(...)`` the problem may become feasible again. The resultant solution is sometimes, but not necessarily, optimal.

My rational  for choosing ``status=4`` is to be conservative when claiming a successful result. For all cases where this occurs a ``OptimizeWarning`` is raised in ``_apply_pivot(...)`` (see: #9081). Maybe returning a status of 0 (Optimization terminated successfully), with a warning of possible numerical errors is more relevant?

An example of this ``TestLinprogSimplexNoPresolve.test_issue_6139`` The pseudo objective function evaluates to ``5.1e-10`` with the tolerance of ``1e-12`` and is therefore not considered close enough to zero to find a basic feasible solution. This is explained in the exit message: 

https://github.com/scipy/scipy/blob/1ec1c8ab24d57a5c46adf68b8f6cdae2faa975da/scipy/optimize/_linprog_simplex.py#L595-L603

The other failing test  is ``TestLinprogSimplexBland.test_issue_8174``. The test returns a status of 0 and ``success=True``, with the wrong result. A basic feasible solution is correctly found at the end of phase one, however in phase two division by a small pivot value leads to the simplex method ""exploding"".  The pivot value is small enough that a warning is issued:

I'm also not quite sure how this should be handled; the test returns the wrong result while claiming it is correct, however a warning is issued notifying the user the solution may be wrong.",Kai-Striega,30074037

197870442,Deprecate calling get_window() with strings,6895,3997018,scipy/scipy,"['scipy.signal', 'wontfix']",closed,19,2016-12-28T15:28:33Z,2017-01-03T21:27:47Z,2017-01-03T07:54:56Z,"The current implementation of [`get_window()`](https://github.com/scipy/scipy/blob/a62a60f0081c475f418c23e966792947563929c9/scipy/signal/windows.py#L1681) is very messy and has many conceptional problems:

## Pointless for user calls

In cases where the user calls the function it serves **no real purpose** besides reshuffling the function call: These two are equivalent, so why use `get_window` in the first place?

``` python
scipy.signal.windows.cosine(16)
scipy.signal.windows.get_window('cosine', 16)
```

And **obfuscates the window function API** with some weird tuple-syntax. The first one is readable with no scipy knowledge, the second one is weird:

``` python
scipy.signal.windows.kaiser(16, beta=1.0)
scipy.signal.windows.get_window(('kaiser', 1.0), 16)
```

## Parameter binding

I understand the reasoning that you may want to **parameterize the window function from outside another function**, so you can have interchangeable window functions in some other code. But using `functools` you can achieve the same and result in much more descriptive and transparent code:

- making it clear what is being used (`scipy.signal.windows.kaiser`)
- making it clear what parameter being partialled out (`beta`)
- can be mocked easily (both input and output are calleable)

``` python
winfunc = functools.partial(kaiser, beta=1.0)
# ...
winfunc(16)
```

`get_window` uses a very opaque API (a tuple with some special meaning) that needs people to
- Go dive deep in the code to find out where `winfunc` is later being used, discover it is a call to `get_window`
- Then read the `get_window` docs to understand what is going on
- needs monkeypatching of scipy to be mocked

``` python
winfunc = ('kaiser', 1.0)
# ...
get_window(winfunc, 16)
```

## Functions as strings

Another argument for using it may be that you can parameterize the **window function as a string**. If you really need to, however this can also be done using `getattr`, too.

``` python
getattr(scipy.signal.windows, 'boxcar')(16)
scipy.signal.windows.get_window('boxcar', 16)
```

## Tight coupling

Because of the very different additional parameters of all functions, `get_window` is [quite closely coupled with each window's interface](https://github.com/scipy/scipy/blob/a62a60f0081c475f418c23e966792947563929c9/scipy/signal/windows.py#L1749), doing parameter resolution and checking that should really be

- done by the window-function
- defined and documented by the window-function interface

`get_window` replaces that ""nice Python function API with keyword arguments and default values"" with a few lines of code that is superfluous, really hard to understand and hard to test.

## Current use in SciPy

I understand `get_window` is mainly used in in `firwin`, `firwin2`, `peridogram` etc:

``` python
from scipy.signal import window

firwin(100, 0.1, 'nuttall')
periodogram(x, fs, ('kaiser', 0.1))
```

However, this is more opaque and less testable than

``` python
from scipy.signal import window
from functools import partial

firwin(100, 0.1, window.nuttall)
periodogram(x, fs, partial(window.kaiser, beta=0.1))
```

The latter would in some cases produce nicer error messages, too. Imagine

``` python
from scipy.signal import window

firwin(100, 0.1, 'nonsense')
firwin(100, 0.1, window.nonsense)
```

the first line will show some obscure error in `scipy/signal/windows.py` whereas the second line will point to the mistake _in your script_.

Therefore this PR aims to deprecate `get_window` and ask people to use the window functions (or partialled out parameters) directly:

 1. It adds functionality to pass a `callable` to `get_window()` 
 2. Replaces all occurrences in `scipy.signal` where a `string`/`tuple` based call was used
 2. Raises a `DeprecationWarning` (although it is not visible?) if no `callable` was passed
 3. Raises a `DeprecationWarning` if [`window=None` is passed to `firwin`](https://github.com/scipy/scipy/pull/6895/files#diff-e3cb9a440373ea91c1efcd3937304d85R436). `None` was used as an alias for `windows.rect`.


## Future steps

Once this is merged, the following steps must be done to finalize the deprecation:

 1. Remove most of the [`get_window()` logic](https://github.com/scipy/scipy/blob/a62a60f0081c475f418c23e966792947563929c9/scipy/signal/windows.py#L1739-L1768)
 2. Remove most of the related [parameter tracking code](https://github.com/scipy/scipy/blob/a62a60f0081c475f418c23e966792947563929c9/scipy/signal/windows.py#L1643-L1678)
 3. Change the unusual [`window` argument in `firwin`](https://github.com/scipy/scipy/pull/6895/files#diff-e3cb9a440373ea91c1efcd3937304d85R436), using the default value `None` as an alias for `window=signal.windows.hamming` and asking the user to use `window=windows.windows.rect` if they wish to do so.
 4. Some completely unrelated functions [additionally check for `string`/`tuple` windows](https://github.com/scipy/scipy/blob/4fbca70cb4829134cfe1b986ff2b77d8f41e0ee3/scipy/signal/spectral.py#L810). This logic should be dealt with.

185241621,ENH: A method to return the numerical inverse of a function,6725,3997018,scipy/scipy,"['needs-decision', 'wontfix']",closed,33,2016-10-25T21:41:11Z,2017-02-09T13:33:51Z,2017-02-09T13:33:37Z,"Updated: 01/11/2016

EDIT: While decision is being taken I have uploaded the current implementation as a [standalone PyPI package](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pynverse).

A method specialized on calculating the numerical inverse of any invertible continuous function.

DISCLAIMER: The problem of calculating the numerical inverse of an arbitrary function in unlimited or open intervals is still an open question in applied mathematics. The main purpose of this package is not to be fast, or as accurate as it could be if the inverse was calculated specifically for a known function, using more specialised techniques. It is essentially a very user-friendly wrapper that uses the existing tools in scipy to solve the particular problem of finding the inverse of a function meeting the continuity and monotonicity conditions, but while it performs really well it may fail under certain conditions. For example when inverting a `log10` it is known to start giving inccacurate values when being asked to invert -10, which should correspond to 0.0000000001 (1e-10), but gives instead 0.0000000000978 (0.978e-10). [This message](https://github.com/scipy/scipy/pull/6725#issuecomment-256722654) from @josef-pkt decribes the decision that needs to be made very well.

Examples:

It can be used to calculate the inverse function at certain `y_values` points:
```python
    >>> cube = (lambda x: x**3)
    >>> invcube = inversefunc(cube, y_values=3)
    array(3.0000000063797567)
```

Or to obtain a callable that will calculate the inverse values at any other points if `y_values` is not provided:
```python
    >>> invcube = inversefunc(cube)
    >>> invcube(27)
    array(3.0000000063797567)
```

It requires the function to be continuous and strictly monotonic (i.e. purely decreasing or purely increasing) within the domain of the function. By default, the domain includes all real numbers, but it can be restricted to an inverval using the `domain` argument:
```python
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> inversefunc(np.cos, y_values=[1, 0, -1], # Should give [0, pi / 2, pi]
    ...             domain=[0, np.pi])
    array([ 0.        ,  1.57079632,  3.14159265])
```

Additionally, the argument `open_domain` can be used to specify the open/closed character of each of the ends of the domain interval:
```python
    >>> inversefunc(np.log10, y_values=-2, # Should give 0.01
    ...             domain=0, open_domain=[True, False])
    array(0.0099999999882423)
```

Or on both ends simultaneously:
```python
    >>> invtan = inversefunc(np.tan,
    ...                      domain=[-np.pi / 2, np.pi / 2],
    ...                      open_domain=True)
    >>> invtan([1, 0, -1]) # Should give [pi / 4, 0, -pi / 4]
    array([  7.85398163e-01,   1.29246971e-26,  -7.85398163e-01])
```

Additional parameters may be passed to the function for easier reusability of callables using the `args` argument:

```python
    >>> invsquare = inversefunc(np.power, args=(2), domain=0)
    >>> invsquare([4, 16, 64])
    array([ 2.,  4.,  8.])
```

The image of the function in the interval may be also provided for cases where the function is non continuous right at the end of an open interval with the `image` argument:

```python
    >>> invmod = inversefunc(np.mod, args=(1), domain=[5,6], 
    ...                      open_domain=[False,True], image=[0,1])
    >>> invmod([0.,0.3,0.5])
    array([ 5. ,  5.3,  5.5])
```

Additionally an argument can be used to check for the number of digits of accuracy in the results, giving a warning in case this is not meet:
```python
    >>> inversefunc(np.log10, y_values=-8, # Should give 0.01
    ...             domain=0, open_domain=True, accuracy=6)
    pynverse\inverse.py:195: RuntimeWarning: Results obtained with less than 6 decimal digits of accuracy
    array(9.999514710830838e-09)
```

Examples of using the callables with vectors to make plots, and compare to the analytical inverse:

![examples](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12649253/19738042/cf22460a-9bad-11e6-9c17-6fdd6cda0991.png)

Each of those calculated as simply as:

``` python
log = lambda x: np.log10(x)
invlog = scipy.misc.inversefunc(log, domain=0, open_domain=True)
x1=np.linspace(0.00001,10,100)
x2=np.linspace(-5,1,100)
ax1.plot(x1,log(y1),'b-')
ax2.plot(x2,invlog(x2),'b-')

invlog_a = lambda x: 10**x
ax2.plot(x2,invlog_a(x2),'r--')
```

The good thing about this is that checking the result of the inverse function is as easy as checking that f(finv(x))==x, so even if the user inputs a non valid function, they can always make sure that the output is consistent or good enough, in fact the function checks this internally automatically. 
I see two type of users:
- Users who need a quick way to get the inverse of a function, so they do not have to invest time on doing it themselves. They could use it, check if the results, and if it does not work, then decide to invest the time to do it manually with more sophisticated approaches. Nevertheless for many cases this will be good enough (See examples above).
- Other functions that deal with monotonic functions, such as inverting cdf to ppf, or the normalization classes from matplotlib, which takes data intervals and map them linearly or non linearly to the 0-1 interval, using different non-linear functions. Essentially, any function that takes a callable of this characteristics, and may need at any point the inverse function, could very easily make use of this numerical approximation of the inverse.

The summarized internal strategy is the following:
0. Homogenize and normalize the input parameters.
1. Figure out if the function is increasing or decreasing. For this two reference points ref1 and ref2 are needed:
    * In case of a finite interval, the points ref points are 1/4 and 3/4 through the interval.
    * In an infinite interval any two values work really.
    * If f(ref1)<f(ref2), the function is increasing, otherwise is decreasing.
2. Figure out the image of the function in the interval. 
    * If values are provided, then those are used.
    * In a closed interval just calculate f(a) and f(b), where a and b are the ends of the interval.
    * In an open interval try to calculate f(a) and f(b), if this works those are used, otherwise it will be assume to be (-Inf, Inf).
3. Built a bounded function with the following conditions:
    * bounded_f(x):
        * return -Inf if x below interval, and f is increasing.
        * return +Inf if x below interval, and f is decreasing.

4. If the required number y0 for the inverse is outside the image, raise an exception.
5. Find roots for bounded_f(x)-y0, by minimizing (bounded_f(x)-y0)**2, using the `Brent` method, making sure that the algorithm for minimising starts in a point inside the original interval by setting ref1, ref2 as brackets. As soon as if goes outside the allowed intervals, bounded_f returns infinite, forcing the algorithm to go back to search inside the interval.
6. Check that the solutions are accurate and they meet f(x0)=y0 to some desired precision, raising a warning otherwise. 

Summary of the discussion:

Arguments to include it:
1. The use case is important and it would be good that scipy included this.
2. The wrapper is very user friendly and easy to use.
3. The current implementation works well in most cases (see examples) and even for extreme numbers, e.g. inverting a log10 the provided function `invlog = scipy.misc.inversefunc(lambda x: np.log10(x), domain=0, open_domain=True)` it is as accurate as `invlog(-10.)==9.786080337061437e-11`.

Arguments to not include it:
1. The function adds more as a wrapper that uses other scipy tools to perform the calculations, so it really is not a new numerical technique.
2. There are a lots of caveats regarding achieving a desired precision, specially for open domains, or infinite domains, as this is still an open problem in maths.
3. It is impossible to check that the callable provided by the users meets the required input conditions of monotonicity and continuity, and this can lead to bad behavior.

Responses to the arguments against
1. I agree, this is why I included it in the misc folder.
2. The accuracy of the results can always be checked using the original functions by making sure that f(finv(x))==x, if the accuracy is not good enough, the user can always try to go to a fancier implementation specialized for each case.
3. In general any function taking a callable is exposed to this risk, as there are only so many checks that one can do for a callable.

Although correlation is not mathematically defined for constant input vector, it makes sense to complete the definition at the limits of vectors with zero variance as 1, the middle point for the domain of the correlation distance. One vector's lack of variance does not say anything about any other vector variation.

The choice [is also justified](http://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/18333/what-is-the-correlation-if-the-standard-deviation-of-one-variable-is-0) by the fact that if one's variance is zero, it follows that the covariance is also 0, and therefore correlation distance is 1.

I did not observe issues with other distance functions, except `yule`.

As part of the Asset change, `PartialEmoji.__init__`'s args were made keyword-only.
This reverts a change made as part of be227ebcf0c8bad6b56798339b5414b8da414dc0.

I think that three-argument unnamed PartialEmoji construction is OK because the order matches the format of an emoji string (animated, name, id).

With the existing code I would have had to modify the keyboard's `q11.c` to achieve what I wanted, with this I just have to add lines to _that specific layout's_ rules.mk.

Key chatter has been widely reported in the createkeebs's Discord for the Thera75 PCB. After a cursory look, I noticed that all the firmware source code I looked at for other popular boards had this DEBOUNCE interval defined. It looks like this value follows Cherry's own data sheets that state that bounce can occur for <=5ms for MX switches.

First time contributing, so please let me know if I'm missing anything! Thanks.

Moves rules.mk processing for userspace to a proper position (eg, keyboard -> userspace -> keymap/layout), and adds a `post_keymaps.mk` that runs after keymap processing. 

However, I'm hard pressed to even come up with an example where this is needed, or even useful. *ESPECIALLY* in favor of something like #9058, as that is something we sort of already have (`LAYOUT_HAS_RGB`).

Not only is this nonsensical, but it's impossible to debug, as it doesn't actually match a known SEH exception. It's a bit of a miracle that this actually worked before.

I changed it to throw a `std::bad_alloc` when scintilla returns `SC_STATUS_BADALLOC`, and a `std::exception` when it returns any other non-success status.

Steps to reproduce:

1. Clone https://github.com/lmk123/firefox-addon-interactjs-bug
2. In Firefox: Open the `about:debugging` page, click ""This Firefox"" (in newer versions of Firefox), click ""Load Temporary Add-on"", then select manifest.json file in the extension's directory.
3. Open https://www.google.com, a ""drag me"" text will appear in the upper left corner
4. Open dev tools, switch to the ""Debugger"" tab, and check the ""Pause on exceptions"" option on the right
5. Now, drag the ""drag me"" text

You will see this error in Debugger:

You can edit manifest.json, replace `interact.js` to `interact-fixed.js`, reload the extension and the 
google web page, now everything work fine.

If the pull request contains code please make sure there is an issue that we agreed to resolve (if it is a documentation improvement there is no need for an issue).

Please answer the questions below.
-->

**What issue does this pull request resolve?**
Ajv assumes console to be present in the environment. It is an acceptable for all normal use cases. But we use AJV within Node VM module and that is sandboxed to not have console.

The following line https://github.com/epoberezkin/ajv/blob/master/lib/ajv.js#L488 assumes console to be present. This results in issues such as [postmanlabs/postman-app-support#3199](https://github.com/postmanlabs/postman-app-support/issues/3199) and requires to have a longer boilerplate code.

As reported in: https://github.com/epoberezkin/ajv/issues/950

**What changes did you make?**
Inserted a stub console if global console is absent

**Is there anything that requires more attention while reviewing?**
- Is it okay to inset a stub console or is it wise to check for console before every use? I prefer the former.

This is based on the method proposed in the most recent comment by @colinhacks - however, instead of just changing the `.message` getter, I decided to play it safer. If the appropriate flag is not passed to the parse functions or `ZodError` constructor/create, input data is not stored anywhere on issues or errors. If the flag is passed, input data is stored on each issue, and is printed out with the rest of the error/issue data. With this method, no changes were needed to formatting or printing functions. 

I felt more comfortable with this, since there's no telling how downstream users may be logging errors and issues, and I'd rather just not include the input data at all if it's not explicitly requested.

The flag takes this form, as an argument to the various parse functions:
```mySchema.parse(myData, {errorOpts: { printInputData: true }})```

I went with this for two reasons:
* Future flexibility and ease of adding additional options for errors.
* Being very explicit about what is desired.

With that said, it wouldn't be hard to do `ParseParams & ZodErrorOpts` instead, making the call look more like:
```mySchema.parse(myData, {printInputData: true })```

Super happy to implement it that way instead, if anyone has strong opinions. It's certainly more pleasing to look at, and easier to type.

I added a test which verifies the correct behavior on `.safeParse` both with and without this flag. I'm happy to add more tests for the other parse functions, if needed.

I haven't updated the docs yet, because I wanted to get some feedback on the methodology and naming before doing that.

Last thing: `printInputData` was the first name that came to mind, but I'm certainly open to more semantically-correct or easier-to-type names if anyone has opinions.

It'd be nice to have an option for forcing the default `unknownKeys` strategy on all objects that have not explicitly defined their own unknownKeys behavior. In real life, I sometimes need to have just one schema for one complex object, but once with `strict` strategy (mostly in endpoint input validations to avoid mistakes) and once with `passthrough` (for response validation from 3rd party APIs). With the current Zod version, I don't see any simple solution for my use case without big code duplication. So I'd like to know your opinion on my PR that perfectly solves my problem.

708799387,Discussion: Optional Tuples - Concept (For #149),167,4070851,colinhacks/zod,['wontfix'],closed,1,2020-09-25T09:42:07Z,2022-03-09T03:52:11Z,2022-03-09T03:52:11Z,"I created this to show a possible implementation of optional elements in tuples. I didn't really create a finished version since you are in the middle of your v2 rewrite.

This implementation does not fully align with Typescript as there is no need to impose a restriction on where optional elements may appear. That could be added too - quite easily with TS 4 - but I didn't try to solve that here.

It does seem though that it imposes a restriction on the order in which the tuple entries are parsed - which seems to  not mesh with the async aspect of the parser the way it has been implemented. Though - the serial parse can be turned into a promise chain instead of an array of promises.

Given
```ts
 const tuple = z.tuple([ 
              z.string().optional(), 
              z.number(), 
              z.boolean().optional()
] as const)
```

BTW- I experimented with what errors to give. The most sensible was:

```
# of values < # required values ->  `too_small`
# of values > # specified values -> `too_big`
at an optional item, only show an error if there is a mismatch, and no more items follow, and do not consume the input.
at a required value, show an error if there is a mismatch consume the input
```

Hi,

just added some integration tests with cypress (#776 ). The only test that is unpassed currently is  'changes the render after code change'. I have added 'scrolls to the component clicked in the sidebar' and 'typing in the sidebar should filter components in the table of content' tests, also corrected 'toggles isolated component mode correctly' for core and component. Feel free to review it and send me feedback, I really appreciate it as a beginner.

Even if create-react-app (which provides webpack) is supported we still need to declare a peerDependency so that we remain compatible. Also, since `clean-webpack-plugin` is depended upon by react-styleguidist, then it's up to styleguidist to provide webpack - either through a regular dep, or a peer dep.

NPM will still choose CRA's version of webpack (provided you're compatible with it). Another reason is Styleguidist doesn't declare which version its compatible with, it can't be every version of webpack.",jasonwilliams,936006

* Mdx is now used to parse and render Markdown files (`src/loaders/mdx-loader.ts`).
* Most of the Markdown processing is done using Mdx (Rehype) plugins (`src/loaders/rehype/*`).
* We still render Markdown in comments using `markdown-to-jsx`. Many comments aren't written as Markdown and contain things like `imports` that would be treated as JavaScript by Mdx. `markdown-to-jsx` is about 5 KB so it's okay to continue using it.
* Most of the `src/client/rsg-components/mdx/Mdx*` components are migrated from the old Markdown components without any changes, and they are used for rendering both: Mdx and Markdown (`markdown-to-jsx`).
* Mdx is used to parse modifiers in fenced code blocks, so JSON modifiers are no longer supported.

While using Styleguidist at work, I found that it would be helpful to have the function signature (ie: `funcName(): void` or so) display in the description for the Props & Methods table.

I had the same needs, and was able to implement multiple theme support by customizing several components, but it felt a bit hacky and brittle. I thought I'd suggest a general solution:

- add support for styling internal components per theme
- provide the current theme to external components
- implement a basic UI for switching themes

The idea is to extend the config with a ""themes"" options, while maintaining support for the existing ""theme"" option. When multiple themes are configured, a simple theme switcher is rendered in the sidebar (which can be easily customized). The current theme is stored in the StyleGuide context, so it can easily be picked up in the Wrapper component and passed to external components.

As you know, at the moment JSX code can either be inlined into Markdown or loaded from an external file using [this technique](https://react-styleguidist.js.org/docs/cookbook.html#how-to-display-the-source-code-of-any-file). The relevant code looks like this:

    ```js
    import MyComponent from './MyComponent';
    ;<MyComponent/>;
    ```
    
    ```js { ""file"": ""./MyComponent.js"" }
    ```

Both of these suck because:
1. They are transpiled by Buble instead of Babel (or whatever Webpack config is using), meaning you don't get ES7 features like class properties and other relevant advantages.
2. They don't get hot reloaded, because Webpack doesn't even watch them.

A temporary solution during development is to use this snippet in `styleguide.config.js` (ignore `props.settings.displaycontent` for now):

```js
module.exports = {
    updateExample(props, exampleFilePath) {
        const {settings, lang} = props;
        if (typeof settings.componentPath === 'string') {
            const filePath = path.resolve(path.dirname(exampleFilePath), settings.componentPath);
            const props = {
                content: `import ExampleComp from '${filePath}';\n;<ExampleComp/>;`,
                settings,
                lang,
            };
            // Use lower case, since settings are converted to lowercase for some reason...
            props.settings.displaycontent = fs.readFileSync(filePath, 'utf8');
            return props;

        }
        return props;
    },
};
```

You can now define a component as your normally would with React:

```jsx
// FullDemo.js
export default class FullDemo extends React.Component {
    // ...
}
```

And then put following 2 lines in your markdown:

    ```js { ""componentPath"": ""./FullDemo.js"" }
    ```

When this markdown file will be compiled by Styleguidist, the resultant code generated by `updateExample(...)` will look as follows:

```jsx
import ExampleComp from '/abs/path/to/FullDemo.js;
;<ExampleComp/>;
```

This last part, in turn, will make your example render as intended, **while also transpiling the code using Wepback's config AND enabling hot-reloading**.

The only issue at this point is that the code editor in the `Playground` component will show the meaningless `ExampleComp` code. To give developers some sense of what code is actually being rendered, I propose adding a `props.settings.displaycontent` property as seen in `updateExample(...)` code above. This will let developers override what code is shown in the code editor below the example preview. Even though `displaycontent` code will not be editable nor hot-reloadable, it's much better to have inline JSX hot-reloading during development time than no hot-reloading at all. During build time, perhaps, Styleguidist could somehow fallback to default behaviour and render the code from the component again.

**PR commit message:**

Add a new property called `displayCode` to the `Playground` component.
When this property is set, the code displayed in the editor below the
example preview will come from `displayCode` instead of the usual `code`
property.

This can be used to enable hot-reloading and transpiling during
development, see the relevant pull request description.",TimboKZ,5504588

So,  `absolute/path/to/file/Readme.md/Example.jsx` will be resolved, which is wrong.
To fix it as developer I have to change ./Basic.jsx to ../Basic.jsx, which is wrong :)

Proposition is in doc.

2. ```import``` is not supported in *.md. So, when we wants to add to *.md any  js|jsx example that  use ```import``` `CompileError: import is not supported` will be thrown. 
 
So, for now ```updateExample()``` method should always with be used with ```settings.static = true``` in case of all js|jsx with ```import```. For us as developers it has more sense, otherwise it push us to use 'require' in our components.

i desire, but ATM cannot have:

1) free maintenance and updates to RSG components as they are developed, **plus**
2) the ability to tweak RSG components slightly (beyond the theme APIs)

# solution

- improve RSG component composition by proxying unhandled props to the target DOM node
    - use `transform-object-rest-spread` to do this.  woo hoo!
    - ideally it would be nice to extend this pattern to other components, but i thought a small focused change would help the discussion along

# example

i want to apply a class name and/or an id to the `<StyleGuideRenderer />` 
```jsx
import * as React from 'react'
import OrigStyleGuideRenderer from 'react-styleguidist/lib/rsg-components/StyleGuide/StyleGuideRenderer.js'
export default function StyleGuideRenderer (props) {
  return <OrigStyleGuideRenderer {...{ ...props, id: 'bananas', className: 'sans-serif' }} />
}
```

# discussion

- the `contributing.md` steps don't work for me, even on master.  `jest` craps out with:

```
react-styleguidist/test/jestsetup.js:15
    import { configure, shallow, render, mount } from 'enzyme';

We're using styleguidist as a part of a big client project, and alost immediately ran in to problems with that the components all live in a global namespace, mentioned in #325, #919 and other places. 

Requiring the specific components that you need is a bit ugly but works to solve naming conflicts in the examples. I'd like to take a stab at fixing this as well at some point, but we had a more critical problem with the routing.
 
When using styleguidist with the `pagePerSection` option set to true the routing use the section or component name instead of it's slug as a path/hash, meaning sections with conflicting names are completely unreachable.

Since the slugs we're already in place to (I assume) handle this very problem when you don't use the `pagePerSection` option using them here as well seemed like a reasonable solution. 

The slug generation could possibly be improved further by prefixing child-section slugs with the parent section, allowing for for more meaningful and stable urls (e.g. `button/button` and `toolbar/button` instead of `button` and `button-1) but this might be a breaking change for some.",jonatansberg,58557

<p><em>Sourced from <a href=""https://github.com/trentm/json/blob/master/CHANGES.md"">json's changelog</a>.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<h2>10.0.0</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Backward incompatible</strong> and <strong>security-related</strong> change to parsing &quot;lookup&quot; strings.</p>
<p>This version restricts the supported syntax for bracketed <a href=""https://trentm.com/json/#FEATURE-Lookups"">&quot;lookup&quot;
strings</a> to fix a possible
vulnerability (CVE-2020-7712). With a carefully crafted lookup string,
command injection was possible. See
<a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/trentm/json/issues/144"">#144</a> for a repro. If you use
<code>json</code> (the CLI or as a node.js module) and run arbitrary user-provided
strings as a &quot;lookup&quot;, then you should upgrade.</p>
<p>For the <code>json</code> CLI, a &quot;lookup&quot; string is the 'foo' in:</p>
<pre><code>  echo ...some json... | json foo
</code></pre>
<p>which allows you to lookup fields on the given JSON, e.g.:</p>
<pre><code>  $ echo '{&quot;foo&quot;: {&quot;bar&quot;: &quot;baz&quot;}}' | json foo.bar
  baz
</code></pre>
<p>If one of the lookup fields isn't a valid JS identifier, then the JS array
notation is supported:</p>
<pre><code>  $ echo '{&quot;https://example.com&quot;: &quot;my-value&quot;}' | json '[&quot;https://example.com&quot;]'
  my-value
</code></pre>
<p>Before this change, <code>json</code> would effectively <em>exec</em> the string between the
brackets as JS code such that things like the following were possible:</p>
<pre><code>  $ echo '{&quot;foo3&quot;: &quot;bar&quot;}' | json '[&quot;foo&quot; + 3]'
  bar
</code></pre>
<p>This change limits supported bracket syntax in lookups to a simple quoted
string:</p>
<pre><code>  [&quot;...&quot;]
  ['...']
  [`...`]      # no variable interpolation
</code></pre>
<p>Otherwise generating an error of the form:</p>
<pre><code>  json: error: invalid bracketed lookup string: &quot;[\&quot;foo\&quot; + 3]&quot; (must be of the form ['...'], [&quot;...&quot;], or [`...`])
</code></pre>

842199798,Fixed type definition to allow `null` as acceptable value for `render…,2023,4073584,faridsafi/react-native-gifted-chat,['wontfix'],closed,3,2021-03-26T18:17:44Z,2021-10-20T16:51:39Z,2021-06-26T01:57:38Z,"It is documented that

  > `renderAvatar` (Function) - Custom message avatar; set to `null` to not render any avatar for the message

  Since `renderAvatar={null}` used to show type error and so I had used `renderAvatar={() => null}` instead thinking that it'd reflect the same behavior.
  As I got back to the code a week later, the bad trip began with this:

![rn-gifted-chat-bug](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26021293/112675789-9833da00-8e8d-11eb-8c81-3bf5bb281386.JPG)

  1. In `Message.tsx`, `this.renderAvatar()` is called. Since user's avatar is acceptable to be an `undefined` value, it proceeds ahead by calling `return <Avatar {...props} />` for other user's messages.

  2. After `renderAvatar` is called, in the `render()` function of `Avatar`, this check causes all the trouble:
  `if (renderAvatar === null) { return null;}`

  3. Thereafter, `GiftedAvatar` is rendered with default `null` values for all these messages except the last one. Note that when avatar is `undefined`, `renderInitials` is used in `GiftedAvatar` to show avatar name initials and hence `undefined` is an expected value here. That's why `renderAvatar` prop for `GiftedChat` must be defined.

  4. For the last message by the other use in this sequence of messages, `renderAvatar()` function is called in `Avatar.js` itself, where my function `this.props.renderAvatar` being present renders a `null` React element.

  What worked for me: **Fixed type definitions for `renderAvatar` to allow `null` as an accepted value.**

I was using undefined createdAt's before I migrated to typescript when I discovered the issue.

The only issue I see with this PR is the isSameDay function. My understanding of the function is that it is used for determining message styling, whether or not to display an avatar, and whether or not to create a day header. From that perspective isSameDay should return:

- true when both messages have a null createdAt
- true when diffMessage has a null createdAt
- false when currentMessage.createdAt is null and diffMessage.createdAt isn't.

In my case, I use a `KeyboardSpacer` at the very root of my app, so I don't need this library to deal with that. 
A work-around would have been to wrap my root into a context, and disable the `KeyboardSpacer` on any view that presents a `GiftedChat`.

Hope you find this useful, and up to your coding standards 👍🏻

When i tried to add them in listViewProps in my main js, it still work.
But it will make some render and the scrolling become non-smooth..
So, i add it in the GiftedChat lib and fork this version and used in my app.

I know my coding is not good but i think some of people need those functions so i try to pull it.
Also i am very happy that if someone can improve the code.

---------------- some simple intro

renderDateBubble: the render of date bubble , if set will trigger this function
dateBubbleOffset:  when scroll yOffset bigger this value date dubble will display
sample code : 
```
const DateBubble = (props) => {
    return (
        <View style={styles.container}>
            <View>
                <Text>{props.date}</Text>
            </View>
        </View>
    )
}
```

renderGoBottomButton:the render of go to bottom button , if set will trigger this function
sample code : 
```
const GoToBottomButton = (props) => {
    return (
        <View style={styles.container}>
            <TouchableOpacity onPress={props.onPress}>
                <View>
                    <Text>GO</Text>
                </View>
            </TouchableOpacity>
        </View>
    )
}
```

This is just a PR to provide the textInput ref to the onInputTextChanged callback. The specific reason I have made the PR is to deal with an issue specific to Samsung devices using the predictive text keyboard, in which the keyboard retains state when after the input is cleared. As a result, when the user sends a message, the next time they start typing in the input the predictive text keyboard retains the last word of their previous message at the start of the new message. See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37798584/react-native-when-submitting-a-text-input-in-android-the-word-suggestions-are and https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43233223/react-native-text-input-clear-doesnt-clear-text for a description of the issue. 

I didn't feel like the workaround for this device-specific issue belonged in your library, but I didn't have access to the ref outside of your code to implement it outside the library, thus this PR which provides the ref to the onInputTextChanged callback, and allowing me to do this:

```
onInputTextChanged = (text: string, inputRef?: TextInput) => {
    if (inputRef && text === '') {
      // Dirty workaround for issue with predictive text keyboard on samsung devices
      // See: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37798584/react-native-when-submitting-a-text-input-in-android-the-word-suggestions-are
      inputRef.setNativeProps({keyboardType:""email-address""});
      inputRef.setNativeProps({keyboardType:""default""});
    }
    // ... normal onChange code
  };

I have to say first though that this is more like a proof of concept that I hope the maintainer folks can riff over and we can improve together.

This PR changes the way `decorateHandler` uses component states to schedule render updates so that we can explicitly exclude rendering the component again after `componentDidMount` to avoid cascading updates on the first mount. Instead of piggybacking on the component state, this PR changes that to a normal property in the class to store the state and compare accordingly, then uses `forceUpdate()` to trigger update. It's very crude and I honestly don't like bypassing React and creating a local state of our own — essentially sort of implementing a `shouldComponentUpdate` check even before that lifecycle gets triggered.

Another way we can solve this is to handle state updates in a child component of some sort. We can set the local state there as a prop and only rerender if the props change maybe? Thoughts?

This PR is a somewhat initial, naive approach I guess but I'd be more than happy to start a discussion and do further work/refinements if this is a desired feature that could be useful for others.

The use-cases that I'm facing is that this way a browser hosted UI/App can interact with other applications and share data that goes beyond the borders of the current Document. In order to set the data one would include a `dataItems` props with `[mimeType]: ""value""` pairs from within beginDrag of a DragSource spec.

___

We notice an issue after integrating react-dnd into our app: Our existing drag-and-drop file upload function (which is not built on top react-dnd) failed to work. 

It seems like the event handling code `handleTopDragOver` in html5 backend will aggressively intervene the functioning of other DnD lib. 

```
if (canDrop) {
...
} else if (this.isDraggingNativeItem()) {
    // Don't show a nice cursor but still prevent default
    // ""drop and blow away the whole document"" action.
    e.preventDefault()
    e.dataTransfer.dropEffect = 'none'
} else if (this.checkIfCurrentDragSourceRectChanged()) {
...
}
```

I think it is ok to remove this part of the code, since it is not part this library's concern to prevent ""blow way"" scenario.

I believe if it'll be useful to others, but feel free to disregard it if you don't agree 👍 

Thanks again for your work!

This can be easily reproduced with any stream with 608/708 captions and by seeking back and forth while fragments are being loaded.

The issues that I fixed here include the following:
1. Cues got cleared when a fragment with a lesser presentation timestamp is loaded. 
The new code now only clear cues when initializing the text track and when destroying the library.

2. Captions whose startTime and endTime are in different fragments.
I have the following scenario to illustrate this:
```
    cue1.startTime                         cue2.startTime
                      cue1.endTime                              cue2.endTime
          |--------------------|              |----------------------|
 ...<----------------><----------------><----------------><---------------->....
         frag11               frag12             frag13            frag14
```
Let's say we are currently parsing frag13 and then we seek to frag12. What happens in the previous code is cue2.endTime will be set to cue1.endTime which is incorrect.
Since it would be too much of a burden to reload/re-parse the relevant fragments to get the correct startTime and endTime for this case, what I did is when a non-sequential fragment loading is detected (like when we seek), the endTime is re-evaluated and set to the endTime of the fragment where it was found. In the example above, cue2.endTime is set to (frag13.startTime + frag13.duration). There will be times when we lose having captions (cue2 not showing from frag14.start until cue2.endTime) but I think this a compromise that we can live with (rather than having to keep track of previously loaded fragments and reload them).

3. Searching through TextTrack's cues to determine if it's a duplicate.
We have a problem with having captions doubled or duplicated. This can be easily reproduced on Android Chrome browsers with a roll-up caption stream. I found out that cues in a TextTrack object are sorted by startTime so I just used binary search to find the relevant cue. I then checked its line number and of its adjacent cues in deciding for duplicates.

      routes: [
        {
          path: '/',

        },
        {
          path: '/list',

          component: './item',
        },
      ],
    },
  ],
```
在不需要的时候，可以手动调用方法取消,下例的 `/list` 为上面设置了 keepAlive 的路由 path
```js
import dropByCacheKey from 'umi/dropByCacheKey';
const clearCache = () => {
    dropByCacheKey('/list');
};
```

1. `yarn create umi` + ant-design-pro 初始化项目
2. 使用 `umi block list` 添加 ant-design-pro 基础表单组件
2. 使用 `umi-plugin-locale` 插件进行国际化

**问题**

动态切换语言时，父组件的语言改变了，但子组件不会改变。（未触发重渲染）

**解决方法**

查阅 react-intl 官方文档后，发现有对这种情况的说明：[dynamic-language-selection](https://github.com/formatjs/react-intl/blob/master/docs/Components.md#dynamic-language-selection)

即：要触发子组件的重渲染，在 `<IntlProvider />` 上添加个 key 即可。（ key 的变化会触发重渲染）

改动很简单：


```diff
# umi-plugin-locale/template/wrapper.jsx.tpl

+ <IntlProvider locale={localeProp} key={localeProp} messages={messagesProp}>
  <App />

##### Description of change
## 现状
在js中，使用locals
```js
import { formatMessage, setLocale, getLocale, FormattedMessage } from 'umi-plugin-locale';
```
在ts中使用locals
```js
import { formatMessage, setLocale, getLocale, FormattedMessage } from 'umi-plugin-react/locale';
```
感觉都有点奇怪。
## 修改后
```js
import { formatMessage, setLocale, getLocale, FormattedMessage } from 'umi';
```
## 注意事项
typescript中，tsconfig.json需要设置
```json
""paths"": {
      ""@tmp/*"": [""./src/pages/.umi/*""]
}
```

Either you or a supporter signed this repo up for Open Collective. This pull request adds backers and sponsors from your Open Collective https://opencollective.com/umi ❤️
  
  It adds two badges at the top to show the latest number of backers and sponsors. It also adds placeholders so that the avatar/logo of new backers/sponsors can automatically be shown without having to update your README.md. [[more info](https://github.com/opencollective/opencollective/wiki/Github-banner)]. See how it looks on [this repo](https://github.com/apex/apex#backers).
We have also added a `postinstall` script to let people know after `npm|yarn install` that you are welcoming donations (optional). [[More info](https://github.com/OpenCollective/opencollective-cli)]
You can also add a ""Donate"" button to your website and automatically show your backers and sponsors there with our widgets. Have a look here: https://opencollective.com/widgets

  P.S: As with any pull request, feel free to comment or suggest changes. The only thing ""required"" are the placeholders on the README because we believe it's important to acknowledge the people in your community that are contributing (financially or with code!).

[eslint 配置约定](https://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/shareable-configs)
[typescript-eslint](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/tree/master/packages/eslint-plugin)

## 相关问题
- 部分规则在 ts 下报 `body of null` 错，需要反馈并跟进。  https://github.com/yannickcr/eslint-plugin-react/issues/2187
- 某些规则不支持，跟进中 https://github.com/yannickcr/eslint-plugin-react/issues/2187
- overrides 不支持 extends https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/8813

## 具体的最佳实践探索
这套规则基于 antd-pro，增加了对 ts 的支持。测试了一下可以用，但是也扫出了一堆小问题 @chenshuai2144 @yesmeck @zombieJ 要不要一起来看看和试用下，把规则完善下。搞好了，就可以先在 bigfish 中用起来。

Previously, the `componentWillReceiveProps` method could be called multiple times; triggering multiple costly change detection strategy calls. This would cause the app to block the main thread especially with large data sets or column definitions and often result in 0 changes. 

This proposed update will trigger the change detection strategy once and only when React has detected a change to props. The side effect though is that this is post-render. So determining the changes are now from `prevProps` as opposed to `nextProps`.",coreyroach,2228536

Seems pretty quick and easy and would prevent undesirable side effects like firing 'onRowDataUpdated' even when the rowData prop has not changed. It skips the expensive 'areEquivalent' check, which my guess was the cause of the performance issues. I think the risk of this introducing issues should be low since rowData has to be immutable when using deltaRowDataMode anyway.

Please note, I have not tested this, as I'm not currently familiar with AgGrid's build process etc. I'd be willing to build and test it though if you have some tests for the performance issues so I can make sure this doesn't introduce regressions, since the reason for the original skipPropertyCheck method being added was to address performance issues with deltaRowDataMode and React.",davertron,70140

I saw that ""hidePopupOnMouseEvent"" function is fired and doesn't take care about stopEditingWhenGridLosesFocus property set in gridOptions. I guess should be any kind of check here to prevent popup to hide.

When function addStopEditingWhenGridlosesFocus is called (place where take care about below property in function isStopEditingWhenGridLosesFocus()) the popup is already closed.

To fix that I did those changes so now when addStopEditingWhenGridlosesFocus = false is consistent with cell editing as popup too. The way to close edit is with ESC key as usual and I have added ENTER key too cause with ESC changes are theorically discarded.

Fix #3572

Had to change this behaviour cause I was having trouble setting internal links within global blocks, that's got a collection for itself, and the maxDepth value needed for that feature would be impracticable.

I think I'd seen another issue requesting for the reference field option to select the fields exposed from the referenced collection, which is what this pull request is about, but it may also fix another circular references issues like the one mentioned, as it allows the user to prevent it within the API in certain cases.

### Description

This PR fixes a bug in function `resolveCompiler()` of the `@vitejs/plugin-vue` plugin: When I use `vue` 3.2.12, `vite` 2.7.3 and `@vitejs/plugin-vue` 2.0.1, and also **have installed `@vue/compiler-sfc`**, then i run `npx vite`, but plugin-vue still throws an error: ""Error: Failed to resolve vue/compiler-sfc"".
I think this error can be solved by adding `tryRequire(""@vue/compiler-sfc"")` or is there a better idea?

Currently, if a view is assigned an `el`, when the template html is appended to it (with whatever custom rendering process), it is reflected in the dom. You could use a temporary element, but then you lose the niceties of this.el's integration in the view. It seems like this.el should be precisely the element the view builds, and separate from the target element in the dom. This PR is backwards compatible with current behavior, but allows for this separation. A non-theoretical use case for the separation is for plugins - to be able to pass actual elements for transformation before they are added to the dom. In order to do this now, an `el` must not be passed to the view, and something must sit over the view to manage this. This proposal would allow for the separation of concerns by the view itself.

I could very well be missing something in backbone that would already foster this; or maybe I am too entrenched in how I see views and need to re-imagine their construction. Part of the difficulty in writing this is that there are so many possible scenarios for views - from simple wrappers for already rendered dom elements, to deeply nested hierarchies in single page apps.

If there is positive feedback I'll add tests and update the docs. Thanks for your feedback!

Because of `internalOn` this is hard to implement in user land.
### Use Case

The use case for this is if you had a Model presenting the output of
an expensive continuous calculation (say real time Stock Prices or
a timer).

The `onFirstListener` function can be used to start your expensive
calculation, as you only care about it while the something is listening
to changes in it.

When that item stops listening to changes in it, `onNoListeners` will
trigger, allowing you to clean up your code (unsubscribe the stock price,
or stop the timer or even stop listening to another Event).

In this case, either a view is conflated so that the same model can be accessed in its different facets, the model is passed around to each view, multiple models are used with logic to keep them in sync, or a global model is used. All of these have deficiencies: non-atomic/componentized views, a fragile hierarchy, state issues, or encapsulation breakdowns. 

This pull request proposes a storehouse into which explicitly decided models are saved, and from which can be explicitly drawn. If a model is created with a custom `cid` passed in, the reference returned will be from the storehouse if one exists, or else to the newly create model (whose reference is saved to the storehouse). In this way, using the `cid` from options, there will be no memory hit for how backbone is being used currently.

As proposed then, a view can be sanely small, atomic, componentized, and encapsulated with a model whether it has the only reference to it, or whether there are dozens more, the view does not know and the creation and experience is as desired. When any view changes the model's state, all views update accordingly. If all but the original model remain, or if dozens of new references emerge, each view has the same desired behavior for its model without knowing or caring if other views have the same model.

There are way more lines here than the pull request, as this is more of adding a new philosophic option than it is code (it weighs in with 5 new lines of code, and 4 changed lines). If there is an optimal way to achieve this, or more tests are desired, please let me know!

Promises API provides catch method where exceptions can be caught after the call is done. While working with Backbone one is on his own.

`onTry` extends `Events.on` by wrappping the callback in try/catch what 
in the case of exception triggers `error` event in the context and calls a given error method if it's available

Examples of use:

``` javascript
// -----------
// Example 1
// -----------
// First specify what we do with exceptions
view.on(""error"", function(context, err){
 console.error(err);

// Now subscribe with exception handling
view.onTry(""test-event"", function(){

// Trigger async
setTimeout(function(){

// -----------
// First specify what we do with exceptions

Instead of trying to decode the fragments, which leads to weird double decoding issues, we can just maintain them in the encoded state.

How can we do this? Because it's easy to determine if the fragment has been decoded (either from a browser bug, or from the dev who never encoded it) since we can just check for a decoded character. If we find one, we can assume that the fragment has been run through `decodeURI()` and just invert it with `encodeURI()`. Now we can match encoded fragments with encoded routes, and everything works perfectly. Static parts of the route match, because the route is encoded _and_ the fragment is. And params / splats will be mapped through `decodeURIComponent()`, guaranteeing it'll never throw (cause it's encoded!).

However, we can't do the opposite. Say we check to see if there are any decoded characters. If there are, then we treat it as already decoded, if not, we `decodeURI()`. The problem is, we don't know if that will leave the fragment in a state that will throw when we later `decodeURIComponent()`. Thus, we're back at #3434.

Looks like this all started back in #2862, which added a UMD wrapper in which jquery was omitted as a dependency when a commonjs environment was detected, based on the reasoning that commonjs is for the server side and jquery is not needed on the server side. In this first iteration of the UMD, `Backbone.$` was left undefined in the commonjs environment. However, commonjs was becoming increasingly common on the client side thanks to tools like browserify, Web Pack, component, cartero, et. al. #2862 was then merged so that backbone could be used with jquery in commonjs environments, which added a `require( 'jquery' )` but wrapped it in a try / catch. However, this ""light dependency"" approach ""broke"" browserify, as discussed in #2997, since browserify would fail if jquery was not present. As a result of this issue the [require + try / catch was removed](https://github.com/jashkenas/backbone/commit/f1479e62eb74a2dd85fdf2e20d9c907c5757313e) altogether, and it was made a requirement to explicitly set `Backbone.$` in all commonjs environments.

```
var Backbone = require('backbone');
Backbone.$ = require('jquery');
```

Unfortunately, we've seen this solution also has its share of problems:
- the requirement of setting `Backbone.$ = require('jquery')` is not intuitive and most people miss it, which is a constant source of friction (see #3038 and #3240).
- that pattern can not be used in Firefox plugins (see #3156).
- there are issues when a third party module requires jquery to be set on `Backbone.$` (see #3291). Under the current paradigm, eventhough the module needs jquery to be available at `Backbone.$`, potentially even at load time, the responsibly for putting it there falls on the application developer, not the module author. The module author has no way of guaranteeing what the application developer is going to put there when, and the application developer is burdened by what is really an internal concern of the module.
## Proposed solution

The proposed solution in this PR is to go with the straight forward solution of treating jquery as a standard dependency (as it is in AMD environments). What follows is a break down of how this solution would play out with the various use cases.
### On the server side (node)
#### For people using jquery

Everything just works.
#### For people who do not need a DOM library

jquery will install and will load when the node application starts up, as soon as backbone is `require`d, eventhough it is not needed. However both the disk space it consumes and the time it takes to load are too small to have any consequential impact.
#### For people who want to use a DOM library other than jquery

Same as above case, except that `Backbone.$` will need to be set to the alternate DOM library during startup. (Assuming node_modules has been [deduped](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/dedupe), the backbone module is shared accross the entire application and thus setting `Backbone.$` at application startup is sufficient to ensure that the alternate DOM library is always used by backbone.)
### On the client side
#### For people using jquery

This is the most common case, I think. Using this approach, everything just works for this case as expected. (Note that `npm dedupe` still needs to be run to make sure that only one copy of jquery will be floating around.)
#### For people who want to use a DOM library other than jquery

This is the group of people who would be inconvenienced by this approach. Luckily the inconvenience is pretty minimal. They need to either

a) Explicitly set `Backbone.$` to the DOM library of their choice whenever a page is loaded, and then configure the build tool to ignore the jquery dependency (so that jquery is not dead weight in their js bundle). With browserify, the `exclude` option can be used to have `require('jquery')` return `undefined`:

```
browserify main.js --exclude jquery > bundle.js
```

With Web Pack,

```
{
    plugins: [
        new webpack.IgnorePlugin(/^jquery$/)
    ]
}
```

b) configure their build tool to ""alias"" jquery for another library. With browserify, this can be done with aliasify,

```
npm install --save aliasify
```

Add an ""aliasify"" section to the application's `package.json`:

```
{
    ""aliasify"": {
        aliases: {
            ""jquery"": ""zepto""
        }
    }
}
```

Using WebPack, the [resolve.alias](http://webpack.github.io/docs/configuration.html#resolve-alias) configuration option can be used:

```
{
    context: __dirname + ""/app"",
    entry: ""./entry"",
    output: {
        path: __dirname + ""/dist"",
        filename: ""bundle.js""
    }
    resolve : {
        alias : {
            ""jquery"": ""zepto""
        }
    }
}
```
#### For people who want to use a DOM library with backbone and jquery in other places

Just set `Backbone.$` explicitly to the library of their choosing.
## Comparison with try / catch

Another solution worth considering is to go back to #2862 which wraps the `require( 'jquery' )` in a try / catch. This solution would also address most of the problems with the current approach. However,
1. I don't see a significant upside over the standard dependency approach.
2. #2997 would again be a problem, which we know for sure, since we have been there before.
3. The lack of clarity as to what is actually supposed to be at `Backbone.$` presents a problem for module and meta framework authors. I agree with @akre54's [comment](https://github.com/jashkenas/backbone/issues/2997#issuecomment-67651342):

> Marionette should be using the same jQuery as Backbone and the same jQuery as your app. It becomes an absolute mess when your view's $el property has a different $.fn than the rest of your app

But where is the global jquery object? External modules and meta frameworks can not assume `Backbone.$` is jquery and interact with it as such if there is no firm stance taken. What is `Backbone.$` supposed to be in the baseline case? Is it jquery? Is it zepto? What the heck is it?

If backbone has a standard dependency on jquery then it is clear - the baseline case is that `Backbone.$` === the global jquery object.

<!--
As an aside, Backbone History is an odd case because although it's almost required to use history as a singleton (you can't have two started Histories on the same page), we've exposed the constructor function for creating new instances like all the other classes.

With `sparse` enabled, the `changedAttributes` and `hasChanged` methods will only consider the attributes that have been change by the most recent call to `set`.

Actual use case of mine: I'm writing a layout engine backed by `Backbone.Model`. Many of the attributes depend on the value of others (think `width` depends on `leftGuide` and `rightGuide`). This means if one attribute is changed, many others may have to be recomputed. This dependency chain can get multiple levels deep, as some attributes depend on other computed attributes up until at the top where there are only known or root properties (think `leftGuide` depends on `guides` and `viewportWidth`).

The way Backbone currently does the `change` event the layout engine recomputes the same values multiple times, since `changedAttributes()` will get bigger and bigger and always contain all the properties that changed since the beginning of the chain.

As you can see the diff is very simple and I was able to implement this in my subclass by overriding `set`. But I thought others might benefit from it.

It helps when overriding `Backbone.sync` to provide a ""catch-all"" clause if an error, success (etc.) option was not supplied or in general to place generic post/pre sync processing in one place, rather than on every CRUD call.

This PR makes writing such code easy:

```
var originalSync = Backbone.sync;
Backbone.sync = function(method, model, options, origOpts) {

    // Attach generic error handler if not explicitly specified
    if (!(origOpts && origOpts.error)) {
        var error = options.error;
        options.error = function(resp) {
            if (error) error(model, resp, options);
            alert(""An error has occurred: "" + resp.responseText);

This is important for people who use CommonJS because it solves the issue of **double Underscores** in your compiled files.

Here's the chain of events that lead to the problem:
1. Backbone lists Underscore as a dependency
2. Because of this, `npm install` includes a nested version of Underscore within Backbone's node modules
3. Backbone `require`s in Underscore
4. CommonJS builders like Browserify and Webpack will pull in the instance of Underscore that is nested within Backbone for this `require`
5. In another file (maybe in your app) you `require` Underscore. Note that this only works if you specify Underscore a dependency, or peer dependency, which installs a **second** Underscore in your app's `node_modules`.
6. CommonJS builders pull in the second instance of Underscore for this other `require`.
7. You now have two Underscores in your built file

By specifying Underscore as a peer dependency you acknowledge the fact that Backbone relies on Underscore but users will **most likely have other things that want to use Underscore**. This makes it so there is only one Underscore in your node modules – in the root – and every library will require in the same one.

So what's the solution right now? Either writing hacky shims to force Backbone to use a particular Underscore or telling your compiler to treat it as it isn't CommonJS-ready. Neither of these are good fixes, I think.

This [blog post](http://blog.nodejs.org/2013/02/07/peer-dependencies/) describes peer dependencies in terms of plugins around a central library, but I think that might be limiting the scope of peer deps.

Consequences of this change:
- Using two different Underscores (one for Backbone, one for your app) is much harder
- For folks trying to do that they will need to resolve the dependency conflict, which can be annoying

**Actually the API is simply horrible. I'd like some feedback from the community about names and additional features/improvement.**

With this you can hook on Models' attributes using `model.setHook(attributeName, hookObject);` where:
- `attributeName` is the attribute you want to hook in;
- `hookObject` is an hash (in future could be an instance of a theorical Backbone.Hook) with:
  - `json` (true) : does the hook must end up in `.toJSON()` result?
  - `property` (null) : whatever is here will be put in `model[hookObj.propertyName || attributeName]` as a reference.
  - `propertyName` (defaults to `attributeName`) : see above;
  - `getter` : a function called with `model.get`;
  - `setter` : a function called with `model.set`;

Hooks can be implement on a class basis with:

``` javascript
var MyUserModel  = Backbone.Model.extend({
  hooks: {
    happy: {
      json: false,
      getter: function () {
        return this.get('status').indexOf(':)') >= 0;
      },
      setter: function () {/* no op */}
    }
  }
});
```

``` javascript
var MyUserModel  = Backbone.Model.extend({
  hooks: function() {
    var user = this;
    var messages = new MyMessagesCollection([], { userId : user.id });
    return {

I'd like to open a discussion about the order change events fire after a `.set()`.

Currently, each change event is fired immediately after each attribute has been set. In the case where we are setting many attributes at once, our handlers may depend on other attributes being present.

Right now if we set the attributes `a` and `b` on a model, the order of events is this:

set `a`
fire `change:a`
set `b`
fire `change:b`

I would like to open a discussion and ask if that is the intended order.

Please consider the following scenario. We just received an API call containing many attributes. We also have handlers listening to various change events. If any of those handlers are expecting an attribute to be present, it may not execute properly, depending on the order that the attributes are set.

For example:

set `a`
fire `change:a`
handler listening for `change:a` wants to access the value of `b`, but `b` has not been set yet.

My proposal is to change the order of these events to:

set `a`
set `b`
fire `change:a`
fire `change:b`

I would like to open a discussion about the pros and cons of this change.

See the attached diff for a proposed solution.

934481,The call to delegateEvents() in Backbone.View's constructor can introduce unnecessary performance penalty,363,5427261,jashkenas/backbone,"['enhancement', 'wontfix']",closed,7,2011-05-21T00:24:26Z,2014-07-05T16:24:54Z,2011-05-23T14:33:58Z,"TWIMC:

While investigating performance problems in our Backbone views, the profiler showed us that the call to `delegateEvents()` in the `Backbone.View` constructor was responsible for several seconds of the time to render the view.

We attach 6 events to each of 75 views (in the case that we profiled). The `Backbone.View` constructor ends up calling the guts of `delegateEvents()` 450 times on the default DOM element that Backbone creates to back the view. Later, we attach the view to an actual, dynamically-created DOM element and call `delegateEvents()`, making the same 450 calls hooking up the events to the correct element. The first `delegateEvents()` is wasted time.

Our solution is simple, if heavy-handed--we added a boolean option (`skipDelegateEvents`) to the constructor to skip the call to `delegateEvents()`. If you are attaching a number of events to a large number of views, and you're late-binding `this.el`, you'd set the option to `true`.

We included tests covering the feature. Let us know if you have any questions about this patch!

Clearly I'm a backbone fan as you may have seen [my post](http://andyet.net/blog/2010/oct/29/building-a-single-page-app-with-backbonejs-undersc/#disqus_thread) a few days ago. Take this as a suggestion, I'd love to get your thoughts on this.

When using backbone I find myself repeatedly writing `change` event handlers in my views in an attempt to bind certain attributes of my model to my UI. So I created a declarative syntax for doing this. 

Generally there are two types of bindings I care about. The first, I'll call `contentBindings` these are where I'd like to keep some text in a certain location in my DOM in sync with a certain model attribute. The second are `classBindings` these are where I'd like to set a class to sync with a model attribute or a boolean value that adds and removes an `active` class. I implemented this and wrote some tests for it. 

In short it lets me do this in my views:

```
var View = Backbone.View.extend({
  initialize: function () {
    this.handleBindings();
  },

  // the attribute I wish to bind and the 'selector' to find it like so:
  contentBindings: {
    title: '.title',
    body: ''
  },

  classBindings: {
    open: '.title',
    color: '.title',
    focused: '',
    status: ''
  }
});
```

I really like the result because it makes it super simple to bind a model to the UI using a short declarative syntax that closely matches what you already do with the `events` hash. I mixed in both of those into a single function called `handleBindings` that I added to the view prototype.

I saw a lot of discussion of these types of things in another thread. But I feel like my approach is a bit simpler and more explicit. It's also fairly self-evident, and doesn't feel like it's too much ""magic"".

It sets the classes or content on the parent element in the cases where you just use the empty string `""""` instead of specifying a selector.

Like I said, take it as a suggestion. I can easily do this in a base class in my apps even if you don't feel it's appropriate to include. However, I figured I'd submit it because it seemed like something that _may_ fit into the philosophy/approach of backbone. Love your work. Thanks again!

I think explicitly named getters and setters are much cleaner and more explicit than calling ""get"" or ""set"" all the time, so we might as well provide them out of the box if they are explicitly asked for via `getSet`.

You could even take this approach further and iterate over the keys in `protoProps`, find every member that is not a function, and create named accessors automatically for all of them.

Just a note: I used `getSet` because it was the first thing that came to mind, but I think `accessors` would work just as well (or even better).

This turns out to be really useful when your views become more complex and need to handle multiple types of model events in sometimes subtle ways.

I use different configuration of toasts in my application, and some include changing how the toast is destroyed (ie: loading indicators gets destroyed without a fadeout and without delay).

The current version of Toastr does not allow this because the options are never saved. I suggest simply persisting them using jQuery's `data` mechanism.

Bugfix

## Current behavior
When sigma is placed inside a Shadow-DOM, you cannot hover or click nodes.
Here is a [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/shadow-dom-example-wudc0e?file=/index.ts) to demonstrate.

## New behavior
Now you can!

## Details
The reason this was happening (I believe) was that the `mousemove` event was bound to the document. This meant that if sigma was inside a Shadow-DOM, the event would be re-targeted to the shadow host instead, and thus the equality on this [line](https://github.com/jacomyal/sigma.js/blob/8838fe7d8ca473b3643257782134db678595f6ad/src/core/captors/mouse.ts#L221) would fail even when hovering over the container.

My solution was to add the `handleMove` event to the container as well. This fixes the problem because the event listener remains within the scope of the Shadow-DOM so the event doesn't get re-targeted. 

I kept the original listener bound to the document because it looks like that allows you to handle stage drag events even when the mouse is outside the container. However, this does mean that there are now some redundant events being triggered. When moving over the container, both the container-bound event and the document-bound event trigger, each emitting their own `mousemove` and `mousemovebody` events (though only the new container-bound events have the correct target when inside a shadow-dom). To solve this, we could potentially separate `mousemove` and `mousemovebody` into two different handlers, `mousemove` bound to the container and `mousemovebody` bound to the document. I attempted to do this myself, but it ended up being a more significant change than I anticipated and I don't think I am familiar enough with the codebase to avoid unintentionally messing up other things, so I ended up not submitting those changes.",avenzi,42781525

## What is the current behavior?

Currently sigma.js does not have the ability to hide the rendering of edges via a setting. Such a setting is added here. There are two primary motivations for doing so: 
1. Per https://github.com/jacomyal/sigma.js/issues/1197 this setting should allow for custom canvas edge rendering by users so that curved edges and self-loops may be added by those users. 
2. Performance improvements for large graphs. 

## What is the new behavior?

The user now can show/hide edges via a setting. This setting is set to true by default, i.e. no change in default behaviour.   

## Other information

The large-graphs example has been adapted to illustrate the new setting. This is just to illustrate and need not be included.

As its name implied, it allows to customize React `key` for each row.

The obvious reason is to leverage existing identifiers in the users data, instead of relying on indexes. More practically, this also solves the bug described below (which might be of interest on its own).

---

The bug this solves.

I have have dynamic data in my table, with rows frequently inserted and deleted. Using event delegation on the whole table element, I determine which cell was clicked. Cells have a custom rendered which sets `data-something=""whatever""`, that's how I extract my data the event's target element.

After removing a few rows, I discover the target elements had `data-something` pointing to the wrong data: that of the cell that was previously at the same location. Suspecting some optimization-related-code reusing the same DOM element because it has the same key and type, I tried this quick fix that got it worked.

I'm beginner-level with React, so unsure if that might point out to a deeper issuer.

Anyways, as I read about it, it seems like the bug I have is identical to what is described here: [using indexes as keys is an anti-pattern](https://medium.com/@robinpokorny/index-as-a-key-is-an-anti-pattern-e0349aece318).

> Let me explain, a key is the only thing React uses to identify DOM elements. What happens if you push an item to the list or remove something in the middle? If the key is same as before React assumes that the DOM element represents the same component as before. But that is no longer true.

So, using smarter row keys seems to be the answer to such bugs.",j3k0,191881

Hi,  I'm using MultiGrid wrapped in an ArrowKeyStepper element (in 'cells' mode).  This is working well but currently only the bottom right grid receives scrollToColumn & scrollToRow props from the parent MultiGrid.  Therefore, if navigating with ArrowKeyStepper in the TopLeft/BottomLeft/TopRight grids they do not receive render events and it is not possible to manage focus.

I've run npm test against this and it's all good.  Thanks

<ul>
<li>fix weird error in integration tests - eb860c0</li>

<li>chore: start testing on Node.js 12 and 13 - 3789a30</li>
</ul>
<p>(POSSIBLY) BREAKING CHANGES:</p>
<ul>
<li>the changes from version <a href=""https://github.com/handlebars-lang/handlebars.js/blob/master/release-notes.md#v460---january-8th-2020"">4.6.0</a> now also apply
in when using the compile-option &quot;strict: true&quot;. Access to prototype properties is forbidden completely by default, specific properties or methods
can be allowed via runtime-options. See <a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/wycats/handlebars.js/issues/1633"">#1633</a> for details. If you are using Handlebars as documented, you should not be accessing prototype properties
from your template anyway, so the changes should not be a problem for you. Only the use of undocumented features can break your build.</li>
</ul>
<p>That is why we only bump the patch version despite mentioning breaking changes.</p>

- [x] documentation is changed or added
- [x] commit message follows commit guidelines


##### Description of change

<!-- Provide a description of the change below this comment. -->

- any feature?
- close https://github.com/dvajs/dva/ISSUE_URL


#### Background
- 当前 dva `dependencies`中使用的 history 版本是 `^4.7.2`。 **` ^`** 的语意化是指保持第一个非零版本一致, 这会导致项目中安装的 `history` 永远是 4.x 中的最新版本
- 但是 `history` 并不想我们想的那样严格遵守语意化

比如 4.7.x 中 babel/core 的版本是 6.x

https://github.com/ReactTraining/history/blob/v4.7.1/package.json#L40-L43

但是在 4.9 中

### Description of change

<!-- Provide a description of the change below this comment. -->

#### rewrite API surface in TypeScript
Motivation:
- Current version of dva API is typed by an index.d.ts file which suffers from maintenance by hand. This file has also some typing errors.
- The majority of the dva API typings come from dva-core package, and it's better to only augment it in dva package.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I really confused that I follow you to code this sample ,but it dosen't work. Because   the param of  the function `mapStateToProps`  is `state` and  get the state number value throught it must add the namespace  , or it would take nothing but undefined.

Thanks!

##### Description of change

<!-- Provide a description of the change below this comment. -->

WIP of a proposal to customize the Redux DevTools default settings with:

1. Ability to disable it (if wanted)
2. Ability to pass custom options, e.g. add action sanitizers:
https://github.com/zalmoxisus/redux-devtools-extension/blob/master/docs/API/Arguments.md#actionsanitizer--statesanitizer

Extend current create options with:

```
+ enableReduxDevTools?: boolean => default to true
+ reduxDevToolsOptions?: object => default to current options { maxAge: 30, trace: true }
```

Feedback is very welcome or suggestions on how to do it in case it's already possible to customize it (I wasn't able to figure it out).

- 修改注册model条件
``dynamic.js``
```js
var cached = {};

function registerModel(app, model) {
  model = model.default || model;

  if (!cached[model.namespace]) {
    app.model(model);
    cached[model.namespace] = 1;
  }
}
```
当执行``app.unmodel``卸载model时，并没有修改``cached``缓存，所以重复挂在model时，永远不会执行``app.model``, 应该从``app._models``中判断
```js
function registerModel(app, model) {
  model = model.default || model;
  if (
    !app._models.some(item => {
      return item.namespace === model.namespace;
    })
  ) {
    app.model(model);
  }
}

~~将model name带入select effect function中的第二个参数。
此功能可以方便搭配dva-model-extend使用~~

修正：

為了保持saga原本的select api，因此最後決定新增一個selectState的effect，其API跟select effect一致，不同點在於selector第一個參數傳入的值為當前model的state


以下为使用范例：

``` javascript
const todos1 = yield select((store) => store.todos);
const todos2 = yield selectState((state) => state);
expect(todos1).toEqual(todos2);
```

搭配dva-model-extend使用：
``` javascript
import modelExtend from 'dva-model-extend';

const human = {
  effects: {
    *talk({ payload }, { select }) {
      const name = yield selectState(state => state.name)
      console.log(`My name is ${name}`)
    }
  }
};

### Description of the Change

<!--

We must be able to understand the design of your change from this description. If we can't get a good idea of what the code will be doing from the description here, the pull request may be closed at the maintainers' discretion.

-->
- There are two types of Unicode characters:
- Those that are inside the Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP) and can be represented by a single character
- Those outside the BMP and require 2 characters to be represented correctly
- These two characters are also called surrogate pairs, with the first half called a high surrogate and the second half a low surrogate
- I have added functions to check for both i.e., if char is a high surrogate or low surrogate
- Then I have called these functions in the html-parser flow for both forward typing and backspacing 

### Benefits

- All Unicode characters will be correctly rendered

<h3>⚠ BREAKING CHANGES</h3>
<ul>
<li>all Extensions whould contains '.' so that mean if you have just 'ts' then need to convert to '.ts'</li>
<li>external parameter was removed
Migration plan propose to move all external resources to input usages
Motivation: packages has many inputs which describe in package.json
so that mean need each time to parse all package.json of exsternal resources to understand which etry point need to pick.
But it is base on guesses because entry point may could not contains a documentation and the best way to handle it manualy.</li>
<li>The serve parametr was remove, you can use any other tools which could be refresh and store your html site
The private parameter has removed, use a access</li>
<li>documentation.js will now require node 14 or later.</li>

I have created it, but I'm not able to make it work with my compilated output, maybe I'm doing something wrong? https://jsfiddle.net/uv3a6fxz/
I had some compatibility issues when building with gulp and node 14, but after downgrading to node 10 LTS it worked, maybe it's because of that :S

### Description of the Change

<!--

We must be able to understand the design of your change from this description. If we can't get a good idea of what the code will be doing from the description here, the pull request may be closed at the maintainers' discretion.

-->
The change was making the bulk type feature work when backspacing, but as we don't have any marks on the text when you are backspacing (you don't have the ` anymore, because it was stripped from the original text), I had to save some breakpoints that indicate the position where the bulk ends (when backspacing it's the start position) and the length of the bulk (numChars), to be able to reproduce the same behavior.

I have added a flag to enable this behavior because maybe you don't want this by default.

I modified also the bulk type demo (the demo number 6) to make this change more clear, but I can leave it as it was if it's a problem (I changed the backspeed from 0 to 40)

To understand a bit more the motivations of this change, you can check this issue: https://github.com/mattboldt/typed.js/issues/495

### Benefits

<!-- What benefits will be realized by the code change? -->

It allows you to bulk type in both directions (on type and on backspace), using a flag to enable this mode.

### Issues

<!-- Enter any applicable Issues here -->
I don't think there are any issues created by this feature (and I haven't seen any on the demos page neither), but being under a flag makes it more safe in case I haven't seen something :/

### Description of the Change

When typing out wide unicode characters, an unknown character symbol (�) would appear briefly.  This is because Typed was splitting the character.  This change checks the byte-width of each character being typed or backspaced, and if it's > 1, it will skip to write out the full character, avoiding the unknown character symbol.

JSFiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/3dkfut5w/4/
(I had to use jsDelivr because rawgit is shutting down - it's also cached a slightly older version where I had an off by 1 error)

I updated the demos to include example unicode usage.  Without the change, the Unicode characters will flicker an unknown character symbol �

<h2>10.3.2 - Oops, &quot;Javascript&quot;.</h2>
<p>Tiny tiny release, just to fix the website incorrectly not listing Javascript
in the list of languages you could choose for a custom build.  NPM and CDN
build should not have been affected so 10.3.1 is effectively the same as
10.3.2 for those builds.</p>
<p>If you made a custom build from the website with 10.3 or 10.3.1 you may
want to check and make sure it includes Javascript, and if not, build it again.</p>

<p><strong>Version 9 has reached end-of-support and will not receive future updates or fixes.</strong></p>
<p>Please see <a href=""https://github.com/highlightjs/highlight.js/blob/master/VERSION_10_UPGRADE.md"">VERSION_10_UPGRADE.md</a> and perhaps <a href=""https://github.com/highlightjs/highlight.js/blob/master/SECURITY.md"">SECURITY.md</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>enh: Post-install script can be disabled with <code>HLJS_HIDE_UPGRADE_WARNING=yes</code></li>
<li>fix: Deprecation notice logged at library startup a <code>console.log</code> vs <code>console.warn</code>.
<ul>
<li>Notice only shown if actually highlighting code, not just requiring the library.</li>
<li>Node.js treats <code>warn</code> the same as <code>error</code> and that was problematic.</li>
<li>You (or perhaps your indirect dependency) may disable the notice with
the <code>hideUpgradeWarningAcceptNoSupportOrSecurityUpdates</code> option</li>
<li>You can also set <code>HLJS_HIDE_UPGRADE_WARNING=yes</code> in your envionment to disable the warning</li>
</ul>
</li>

<p>Example:</p>
<pre lang=""js""><code>hljs.configure({
  hideUpgradeWarningAcceptNoSupportOrSecurityUpdates: true
})

I would like to suggest only using JSX inside of .js files. Here is a short rationale for doing so:
- Most modern projects are transpiling code with tools that support JSX. In this case it makes sense to keep everything together inside a single .js file.
- Cleaner import and require statements. For .js files I can import the file by its name, instead of having to include the .jsx file. E.g., `require('./MyComponent');` vs `require('./MyComponent.jsx');`
- While JSX is not ecmascript, it is transpiled JS, in the same vein that flow and stage 0 babel transforms are. There's no reason to differentiate.

1668141326,fix: rate limiter improvement,2580,6830841,optimalbits/bull,['wontfix'],closed,7,2023-04-14T12:12:33Z,2023-06-24T12:28:46Z,2023-06-24T12:28:46Z,"As described in https://github.com/OptimalBits/bull/issues/2235, the current rate limiter will ""lag behind"" on processing of jobs once the rate limit has been exceeded. This is because the current implementation will throttle jobs purely based whether there are any delayed jobs, and attempts to ""space"" out jobs according to the set `max` and `duration`. However, this strategy means that if new jobs come in while processing jobs that have been delayed due to rate limiting, these jobs will be rate limited also, even if the new jobs would not result in the rate limit being exceeded.

The diagram below tries to depict this scenario:

<img src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2518/232035088-5bd03a9a-eb57-425a-9a01-89075fcb79c5.png"" width=800>

The proposed solution instead stacks up delayed jobs at the beginning of the next rate limiter ""windows"".

<img src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2518/232037900-7813f2f2-1114-4d07-9ef5-94403aad5e2e.png"" width=800>

The current tests do not expose this behaviour, as this bug does not surface with `max = 1`. I've included tests with combinations of `max`, `duration` and job counts (`numJobs`), which fail with the current implementation, but pass with the proposed solution. They rely on the fact that processing `numJobs` for a specific `max` and `duration` should be processed in a duration from`(Math.ceil(numJobs/max) - 1) * duration)` to `Math.ceil(numJobs/max) * duration`.",andreas,2518

In other words, after a repeatable job with limit is added and is repeated until exhaustion, if app is restarted the repeatable job is added again with counter reset to 1 and is repeated again.

I had some specific case and found resolution so created a PR.
My case:
1. No available processors
2. New job is added to queue
3. My JS code is starting timer - max time to respond to client (some checks + addjob + processjob + parse result + sending response)
4. When my timer is fired, but no workers available I need to make sure that this job will be not started (it makes no sense to start job when new processor will be available because client already got error response)
So I call:
- job.discard()
- job.moveToFailed(error)

Without my change, job is added to failed list but is still hanging in wait list.

Have a nice day :)",rysi3k,1748665

This caused `concurrency--` to be `NaN` which stopped the queue from processing any jobs. So I've added a quick check to throw an error.

Also in the process while trying to get things running, I was having problems because spread syntax is not supported under node v8.3 - which was making the linter complain.

I also tried to add a test, but there wasn't really an obvious spot to do it. Generally more docs around getting the code up and running and contributing would be helpful.

This resolves issue #1357 and adds an optional parameter for sending through a `sizeLimit` parameter on `opts` when creating a job. If the data you're sending through is larger than the `sizeLimit` set, an exception is thrown.

A couple of notes:

1. I added a dependency called `bytes` which is a small dependency which allows a user to type a  ""human readable"" `sizeLimit` such as `1b`, `1mb`, `1gb`, etc. instead of having to convert everything to bytes themselves. I also added a utility function so that a user can either set the limit as a number in bytes, or the human readable format. If you don't want this other dependency there, let me know and I can make it so that it'll just take the number in bytes that a user types in.

2. I implemented a utility function that I saw on this [stack overflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/a/23318053/1347170) that describes how to count the size of strings, which also include non-ascii characters. Just to be safe, and to support other character encodings, I use this method to calculate the size.",joshterrill,5368757

Previously it was possible to replace attribute values only with strict string matching. This pr will allow you to use regular expressions.
It's tricky to implement this feature without changing the API and at the same time without degrading performance, so it was decided not to change the cli and wepback API of the plugin, but the babel plugin was modernized. If you use only the babel plugin, you can use the key instead of the specific string value of the regular expression in the `value` property, and use the actual regexp in the `regExp` field.

## Test plan

index.css:
```css
body {
    background-image: url('./icon.svg');
}
```

index.html:
```html
<html>
    <head>
        <link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" href=""index.css"" />
    </head>
    <body></body>
</html>
```

Normally, upon bundling, it should output this (as seen in Chrome DevTools):

<img width=""368"" alt=""Screen Shot 2020-05-02 at 17 13 24"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1707/80866702-d84c0600-8c98-11ea-947f-fbd7c86dc8cc.png"">

But with `parcel-plugin-svgr` it outputs this, which is obviously wrong and doesn't get loaded/displayed correctly:

<img width=""364"" alt=""Screen Shot 2020-05-02 at 17 15 44"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1707/80866718-e8fc7c00-8c98-11ea-8875-b4f7d3181e83.png"">

## The fix

The fix is to change the main output type of the Asset to `svg`, and output the original svg as is. Output the transformed JS as an alternative rendition:

```js
return [
      { type: 'svg', value: this.contents },  // original SVG (for CSS imports)
      { type: 'js', value: this.ast }         // transformed AST (for JS imports)
    ]
```

This is basically covered by the Parcel documentation, see the example here: https://parceljs.org/asset_types.html

In the current approach, if `min` value is, for example `1.3`, `_.random` can produce values starting at `1.3`, it's an edge case, but with smaller ranges it's more probable.

I used `Math.round` to change the `min` value into an integer, but if this is not the best behavior I'm happy to change it :).

Current implementation:
```
  _.random = function(min, max) {
    if (max == null) {
      max = min;
      min = 0;
    }
    return min + Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min + 1));
  };
```

New implementation:
```
  _.random = function(min, max) {
    if (max == null) {
      max = min;
      min = 0;
    }
    return Math.round(min) + Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min + 1));
  };
```

Another approach I thought of was:
`return Math.round(min + Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min + 1)));`
but I would like to hear your thoughts.

I am sure there are better ways to get it working, but I think it does the job! 

The sort of thing I was hoping to get working... 

``` javascript
_.range( 1, 5, 1, Math.pow, Math, [2] );
// => [ 1, 4, 9, 16 ]

_.range( 4, 10, 2, Math.pow, Math, [4] );
// => [ 256, 1296, 4096 ]

var factorial = function(n) {
  if ( n === 0 || n === 1 ) { return 1; }
  return n * factorial(n - 1);
};
_.range( 1, 6, 1, factorial, null, [2] );
// => [ 1, 2, 6, 24, 120 ]
```

Sorry, but I changed a few things in the test suites! Only minimal changes, but I tried to get rid of the throws syntax error message, and I also had to up the max-params eslint rule to allow for 6 parameters (probably not a great idea - but that allowed for the new params I tried to let _.range allow).

The parameters that I have added...

``` javascript
_.range( start, stop, step, iteratee, toBind, providedArgs );
```
- `start`, `stop` and `step` are all the same
- `iteratee` is a callback for each iteration of the loop
- `toBind` is what the user wants `this` to be, mainly set up to allow for things like Math.pow
  - I probably could have used `bind` but I am using the toBind variable for the `apply` method
- `providedArgs` expects an array, just so we can pass in static values to the `apply` method later on (if that is necessary)

Hopefully it is okay! Let me know if I can do anything (or any advice, suggested edits etc.)

As the name suggests, the new section, a brief paragraph, explains in plain and straightforward language what Underscore.js is used for and when one should use it.

Other repositories may begin to use this new informative and catchy section soon, as my colleagues contact open-source technologies in an effort to make them more accessible to the tens of thousands of new users learning to code and thousands joining GitHub every day.

131392714,"Configurable option: on interpolation, ignore missing template variables",2435,6889882,jashkenas/underscore,"['wontfix', 'breaking change']",closed,3,2016-02-04T16:02:10Z,2016-02-04T22:31:28Z,2016-02-04T22:31:28Z,"I propose a configurable option here. The option to have underscore partially interpolate templates. 

The idea here is that all template variables are required to be present on interpolation. This relaxes that restraint and leaves a missing template variable exactly as it was before in the template. Leaving it for future interpolation. 

I use underscore in nodejs, as well as backbone in the same application. I have a centralized configuration file that the application uses. The template I use requires configuration information, and user inputted information. The template then is filled out in two stages, once in nodejs and finished in backbone. 

This really helps with with staged templating and accomplishes my and possibility other's use cases. 

The modification is to the **settings** object. 

The addition is the **ignore_missing_template_variables** key. It accepts a boolean value.

The added usage is as follows:

`// partial replace`
`var example_template = '<%= foo %><%= bar %>;`
`var settings = {'ignore_missing_template_variables': true};`
`var template = _.template(example_template, settings);`
`var example_templated = template({'foo': '123'}); // '123<%= bar%>'`

`// ignore variable`
`var example_template = '<%= foo %>;`
`var settings = {'ignore_missing_template_variables': true};`
`var template = _.template(example_template, settings);`
`var example_templated = template({}); // '<%=foo%>';`

This option can be disabled or omitted for original functionality, and custom interpolation tags are preserved.

108509540,Adding comb function. fixes #2305,2306,6889882,jashkenas/underscore,"['wontfix', 'enhancement']",closed,8,2015-09-27T02:51:47Z,2015-09-29T05:23:27Z,2015-09-28T14:25:57Z,"Add Haskell like function definitions using pattern matching.

In Haskell a function can be defined by pattern matching over
argument values.

``` haskell
myFunc :: Int -> Int -> String
myFunc 0 0 = ""Hello""
myFunc 1 0 = ""Goodbye""
```

We can define pattern matches to arbitrary arguments.

``` haskell
myFunc _ 1 = ""Good Afternoon""

(myFunc 10 1) -- ""Good Afternoon""
(myFunc 1 0) -- ""Goodbye""
(myFunc 0 0) -- ""Hello""
```

Last, we can define standard functions simply by defining functions
with non-value arguments, similar to javascript function definitions.

``` haskell
myFunc x y = ""The sum is: "" + (show (x+y)) 
```

Using standard function definitions in javascript, we have to use nested
if statements for each argument case. The same definitions as above are...

``` javascript
function myFunc(a, b) {
    if (b == 1){
        return ""Good Afternoon""
    } 
    if (a == 0 && b == 0){
        return ""Hello""
    }
    if (a == 1 && b == 0){
        return ""Goodbye""
    }
    return ""The sum is: "" + (a+b)
}
```

_.comb allows concise pattern matching using haskell-like syntax

``` javascript
//A default function if no patterns are matched
var myFunc = _.comb(function(a, b){
    return ""The sum is: "" + (a+b)
})

//Cases to match on and values to return
myFunc.link(_, 1, ""Good Afternoon"")
myFunc.link(0, 0, ""Hello"")
myFunc.link(1, 0, ""Goodbye"")
```

The arguments to link sets patterns to match over in a first link,
first match basis. Lastly, we can pattern match on values and supply 
abstract functions to apply arguments to.

``` javascript
myFunc.link(2, _, function(a, b){
    return ""Product of 2:"" + (a * b)
})
```

Sum outputs with the definitions...

``` javascript
myFunc(2, 3) // 6
myFunc(10000, 1) // ""Good Afternoon""
myFunc(100, 100) // ""The sum is: 200""
```

A full example of definitions in javascript...

``` javascript
var myFunc = _.comb(function(a, b){
    return ""The sum is: "" + (a+b)
})
myFunc.link(0, 0, ""Hello"")
myFunc.link(1, 0, ""Goodbye"")
myFunc.link(_, 1, ""Good Afternoon"")
myFunc.link(2, _, function(a, b){
    return ""Product of 2:"" + (a * b)
})

myFunc(2, 3) // 6
myFunc(10000, 1) // ""Good Afternoon""
myFunc(100, 100) // ""The sum is: 200""
```

sorted according to the string representation of its values. sortBy()
compares the values with the less-than and greater-than operators. This
causes undefined orders in phantomjs like these:

```
_.sortBy([1, NaN]) // => [1, NaN]
_.sortBy([NaN, 1]) // => [NaN, 1]
```

but also to real pathological results in Firefox, Chrome and V8 in
general like this:

```
_.sortBy([2, NaN, 1]) // => [2, NaN, 1]
```

where the result is not ordered at all.

This fix addresses these issues by ordering all numbers first and
comparing all other values as strings.

This will break all users that assume that numbers will be ordered
alongside with strings. Unfortunately that ordering is not well defined
(Example V8):

```
_.sortBy(['9', 10, '10']) // => [ '9', 10, '10' ]
_.sortBy([10, '10', '9']) // => [ 10, '10', '9' ]

```
_.sortBy([1, NaN]) // => [1, NaN]
_.sortBy([NaN, 1]) // => [1, NaN]

_.sortBy([2, NaN, 1]) // => [1, 2, NaN]

_.sortBy(['9', 10, '10']) // => [ 10, '10', '9']

This implementation complements #1359 so that each entry in the iteratees array is run through `_.iteratee`, so it can contain both property names and functions.

Here's a silly example sorting on both `name` and `age` (but using a function for the latter):

```
var people = [{name : 'curly', age : 50},{name: 'moe', age: 30},{name : 'curly', age : 27}];
_.sortBy(people, ['name',function(p){return p.age;}] );
// => [{name : 'curly', age : 27},{name : 'curly', age : 50},{name: 'moe', age: 30}];
```

I've toyed with some different approaches to this problem, including what's been suggested in #1751, and I think this is the most intuitive answer. Although it doesn't directly cover all use cases for the #1751 version, such as @megawac 's semver example:

```
var versions = [""0.1"", ""0.1.1"", ""2.0"", ""10.1"", ""6.2"", ""2.0.1"", ""1.7.3"", ""1.10.2"", ""0.2.0"", ""0.3.0"", ""0.6.0"", ""1.0.0""];
_.sortBy(versions, function(version) {
   return _.map(version.split("".""), _.partial(parseInt, _, 10));
});
// => [""0.1"", ""0.1.1"", ""0.2.0"", ""0.3.0"", ""0.6.0"", ""1.0.0"", ""1.7.3"", ""1.10.2"", ""2.0"", ""2.0.1"", ""6.2"", ""10.1""]
```

Catering cleanly to that too would be nice, but I suspect simply sorting on multiple fields is by far the most common use case.

more standardized way to build (minify), lint, document and test
Underscore.js using gulp.js. All npm-scripts have been replaced
with appropriate gulp-tasks.

In particular, the following changes have been made:
- Replace direct usage of PhantomJS with gulp-qunit.
  
  This removes the need to globally install the PhantomJS CLI.
  Further, the test/vendor/runner.js file is no longer needed (but
  still included for now).
  PhantomJS is no longer a dependency. The corresponding npm
  script is no longer needed and has been removed.
  To run the tests, execute ""gulp test"".
- Replace direct usage of eslint with gulp-eslint.
  
  Same as above. Remove need for global installation etc. Lint
  script (previously included in test-script) has been abstracted
  into its own task. Linting can be done using ""gulp lint"".
- Replace build script with appropriate gulp task.
  
  Same as above. Previously, the build was handled by the npm
  script ""build"". In compliance with [informal conventions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U1RGAehQwRypUTovF1KRlpiOFze0b-_2gc6fAH0KY0k/edit), the
  sourcemap file is now called ""underscore-min.js.map"" instead of
  ""underscore-min.map"". Project can be build (minification +
  generation of sourcemap) using ""gulp build"".
- Handle documentation through docco using gulpfile.
  
  docco is still a dependency, since a corresponding gulp-task for
  docco couldn't be found (WIP). Documentation can be generated
  using ""gulp doc"".
## Usage
- Install gulp.js globally using ""npm install -g gulp"".
  
  This is the only dependency which needs to be installed globally.
- Install dependencies using ""npm install"".
- Run tasks:
  
  Old -> New
  npm run-script test -> gulp test/ gulp lint
  npm run-script build -> gulp build
  npm run-script doc -> gulp doc
  Run all: -> gulp

This PR might seem like a lot of overhead, but it makes building, testing, linting and documenting the project much easier, especially for new collaborators that prefer building Underscore.JS themselves. Introducing gulp is a good choice in this case, since it removes the need to globally install all the dev dependencies. Otherwise, the globally installed dependencies might conflict with each other on different projects (e.g. if you need a previous version of uglify in order to build a different project [1]). Extending gulp is much easier and more readable than adding another npm-script. Further, testing is much easier now, since runner.js is obsolete.

  [1]: Another way of circumventing this problem would be to run the binary inside the node_modules directory explicitly (e.g. using ./node_modules/.bin/docco).

However, often times, I need some keys to be renamed. E.g. when getting
a few attributes from one model to send to the API of another model. (I'm
talking Backbone models, but it would apply to anything of course)

Right now, I would do something like that:

``` js
var modelAttr = _.pick(myUser, 'id', 'name');
modelAttr.userEmail = myUser.get('email');

// => {id: '1234', name: 'Jane Doe', userEmail: 'jane@doe.org'}

``` js
var modelAttr = _.pick(myUser, 'id', 'name', {email: 'userEmail'});

I also changed `_.omit` since it mirrors what `_.pick` does and both

There is an `omitWhen` method which allows you to pass a predicate for matching against values. While this can achieve the same thing, the functionality is not explicit, unlike `omitValues`. 

I needed the functionality and I forgot about contrib. No biggy if you think this is to analogous to `omitWhen`.

If you need a use case consider a need for default values, but an object's value for any key could potentially be  an empty string. In my mind, I would think `_.defaults` would be the right choice, but it doesn't see an empty string as an unset value (which makes sense).

```
var props = { age: 43 };
var instanceProps = { name: '' };
var defaults = { name: 'unknown' };
_.defaults(props, instanceProps, defaults); // { age: 43, name: '' } 
_.defaults(props, _.omitValues(instaceProps, ''), defaults); // { age: 43, name: 'unknown' }

One thought on matching values. The behavior will likely be incorrect for objects unless you pass the reference directly as a value to omit. This should probably be of note that you can only omit primitives unless you pass in reference.

It's easier to write markdown than html, but you've already created the html page, it maybe not worth a replacement, and I can understand that.

However, it worths a try, when you start a project from scratch, it would help a lot.

I've transform the html page to markdown at [docs/index.md](https://github.com/lepture/underscore/blob/nico-doc/docs/index.md), and add a task in Rakefile which is `homepage`.

1. Significantly more performant than the current version
2. Supports more cases likely to be used in production
3. Passes the test suite tests for the old memoizer

The implementation in [2] comes with it's own tests in that repo, however what you're probably more interested in looking at are the performance figures. Here's a jsPerf test (others are available) which demonstrates the improvements in performance from the existing implementation when compared to this one:

http://jsperf.com/comparison-of-memoization-implementations/12

The work here has gone through multiple rounds of further optimization by @mathias, @dmitrybaranovskiy, @JamieMason and others and is currently the fastest (thus benchmarked) memoizer we're currently aware of (as you'll see in the tests, we also compare against other implementations by John Hann, Thomas Fuchs etc).

The only real difference between the current approach and mine/ours is that the optional hash function is dropped. I've thoroughly reviewed use of memoization in JS projects out there at the moment and I haven't seen a great number of people actually rely on such optional functions, they just want the main memoizer itself.

It would be great if we could get this in Underscore, but definitely open to thoughts on whether it's worth including.

Notes:

The new memoizer has dependencies on JSON support being natively available [4]. I think this is _okay_, but we're happy to spend more time on support issues if needed. I'm currently looking at putting together a compact stringify method that could be substituted to resolve any compat issues for a future update.

You may also ask whether the perf test is a fair comparison of access/usage times. We've also separately benchmarked these in the earlier stages of development with the newer implementation outperforming the others there too. Happy to create another test to demonstrate if needed.

Thanks!

The difference is that `._project` maps onto objects. It does this by expecting a two-value array. With no iterator given, these are simply the index (or key) and the value -- this means objects stay the same, and arrays of key value pairs become objects. An iterator may transform the data and return a two-value array which become key, value.

I've no particular affinity for the name (just figured it was in the same style as the others). I think it makes sense for it to neither reject nor try to transform and accept iterator results that aren't two-value arrays. Likewise, I think it should not do anything about overwriting keys.

I've added a function called ""omap"", which allows functional mapping on objects. It comes in two flavors:

1) _.omap(o, f)

1) calls function f on each key of o, setting o.key to the result of the called function. 
2) calls function f on each key specified by keys, setting o.key to the result of the called function. 

The object is modified in place and a copy of the object is returned. To call this function without modifying the called object, _.omap(_.clone(o), ...) can be used. I made in-place modification the default because this was my most common used case and is cheaper than always copying the object. 

This function is useful when storing s set of similar items in an object and wanting to act on all of them in a similar way.

This module loads a **[do_GET() -->>send_head()](https://docs.python.org/3.10/library/http.server.html#http.server.SimpleHTTPRequestHandler.do_GET)** method from **[SimpleHTTPRequestHandler](https://docs.python.org/3.10/library/http.server.html#http.server.SimpleHTTPRequestHandler)** class which eventually results in the **directory listing of all items in the current directory from which its original caller was run** ( if no index.html or index,htm file exists in that directory ). Otherwise it serves a http 404 response on listdirectory failure.

A possible but unclear mitigation is to run websockify directly #294. Another but not encouraged solution is **commenting the ""**else**"" block in **send_head(self)** method in python **http.server.SimpleHTTPRequestHandler** class** to force a http 404 response.

Code:
`def send_head(self):`
`....`
`....if not parts.path.endswith('/'):`
`....`
`....for index in ""index.html"", ""index.htm"":`
`....`
`....#else:`
`    #return self.list_directory(path)`

If users are using NOVNC across WAN or a reverse proxy/vpn, there may be caching at play beyond browser caching.
In particular this may be useful for Unraids configuration.
Adding a `no-store` Cache-Control header can prevent unintended caching at the ISP level/levels above the browser cache.

A separate step could be to implement multiple Touch modules for different interaction styles a.k.a convert touch events to mouse events in different ways.

| Touch action | Click event |
|------|------|
| Single Tap| Click|
| Long press | Right-click (contextmenu or click event)|
| Press and then drag | Click and drag (mousemove event) |
| Two-finger press and drag | Pan (Wheel event)|

forwarding of the token [2]. Restoring token forwarding allows users to

## What does it do?

fix open_graph helper on og:meta (article:author) Object Object
Currently, many themes use front matter:
```yaml
author: # author object each pages or posts
  nick/nickname/name: ""name author""
  url: ""http://web.tld/page/profile.html""
```
The above configuration useful to create an author name with a hyperlink that will lead to the `about me` page or a page related to the article's author profile (seo internal/author link/schema jsonld).
**example**
```html
<a href=""{{ page.author.url }}"" alt=""{{ page.author.name }}"" rel=""author"">{{ page.author.name }}</a>
```
```ejs
<script type=""application/ld+json"">
{
  ""@context"": ""https://schema.org/"",
  ""@type"": ""Person"",
  ""name"": ""{{ page.author.name }}""
... and so on
}
</script>
```

## How to test

I test it on my web using `hexo server` and `hexo generate` (https://www.webmanajemen.com repo https://github.com/dimaslanjaka/dimaslanjaka.github.io branch `compiler`), with hexo branch (forked) in folder packages/hexo.
```sh
# alert: this hexo site using submodules as packages with my other hexo plugin inside, and this hexo site contains more than 650 posts. It will taking long time to cloned.

When running the boilerplate in development, the following warning can be seen in the console:
```bash
[Violation] Avoid using document.write(). https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2016/08/removing-document-write
```
This is due to the usage of document.write() within the index.html file. Per the above doc, document.write() is parser blocking which means even if defer is passed in, the write will still execute and block the page rendering. 

After my fix, I tested that I am still getting the appropriate script tags included with the defer tags as previously implemented without warnings.

While building with multiple dependent modules causes conflict in types as typescript validate types in global scope.

**Recreation Steps**
1. Add React components in typescript, with same variable name
2. Run `yarn ts`

**Expected Output**
Successful compilation

**Actual Output**
Gives multiple errors equivalent to  following error

> error TS2717: Subsequent property declarations must have the same type.  Property 'image' must be of type 'SVGProps<SVGImageElement>', but here has type 'SVGProps<SVGImageElement>'.

3114             image: React.SVGProps<SVGImageElement>;

                 
**Fix**
As suggested in [DefinitelyTyped issue workaround ](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/issues/33015) disabled automatic inclusion of @types packages.

As per the document it doesn't skip type check in local scope (only in [global scope](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/tsconfig-json.html#types-typeroots-and-types)).",RimashMohomed,5774551

Please be aware about [multpass](https://togithub.com/CanonicalLtd/multipass/issues/847) bug on macOS if your have custom stage packages for Snap.

##### Bug Fixes

-   **snap:** detect snapcraft version if quoted ([d18909b](https://togithub.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/commit/d18909b))

### [`v20.44.1`](https://togithub.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/releases/v20.44.1)

[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/compare/v20.44.0...v20.44.1)

As result of [Snapcraft Summit Montreal](https://blog.ubuntu.com/2019/03/22/snapcraft-summit-montreal), Snapcraft support was greatly improved:

-   2x smaller size (56 MB vs 125 MB).
-   less user OS dependency, more wider various Linux distros support.
-   easy building even if custom stage packages are used, because of support for [multipass](https://togithub.com/CanonicalLtd/multipass) (Docker support is completely removed).
-   more secure because newer software is used (still, old Linux distros are supported).
-   faster builds on CI, because template snap app size reduced from 48 MB to 1.5 MB (yes, it is not a joke).
-   smaller size of Docker image because snapcraft support was removed.

this is my first PR so don't hesitate to edit it

- Added a ""preGenerateDevPackage.js"" script file which generates a package.json files on the main.dev.js folder, with a modified ""productName"" field ( productName: appName_dev )
- Added code in main.dev.js that, in dev mode, deletes the generated package.json file once the app is launched, so it doesnt interfere with the linter
- Changed two scripts in the original package.json file:
* ""dev"": added a call to the script described above
* ""start-main-dev-"": removed the ""main.dev.js"" file name so electron command just points to the folder containing the generated package.json file described above and creates a 'userData' application folder with the right name

- catch window (renderer) uncaught errors

- Move error reporting logic to middleware
- make better UI for error reporting testing page

## Why?
The base `app` function that Hyperapp supplies is perfect for covering the common use case.  It can be customized pretty easily with Higher-Order Apps and Higher-Order Components.  Unfortunately HOA/HOC can only take you so far.  Some features need to be implemented inside `app` itself.  Features like connected components or context would be beneficial to some, but those not using the features would have to pay the performance price.  The PR is to enable app creation with inversion of control -- empowering users to add the features themselves.

## Details
```jsx
import { h, app } from 'hyperapp';
```
With this PR these would continue to work exactly as they do today; however, a new `hyper` function would also be available.
```jsx
import { h, hyper } from 'hyperapp';
```
The `hyper` function takes a `parseNode` function and returns an `app` function.
The `parseNode` function has the following signature:
```jsx
const parseNode = (node, parent, globalState, wiredActions) => /* node */
```

✳️ **EDIT:** _The `hyper` function has been replaced with an overloaded `app` function.  Example:_
```js
app(parseNode)(state, actions, view, document.body);
```
✳️ **EDIT:** _To be clear, the `parseNode` functions are not supplied by HyperApp, but instead developed by the community.  Below are a few examples I created just to show some of the capabilities._

### Example: App supporting Context
```jsx
const { h, hyper } from 'hyperapp';
// Create the app with a custom node parser
const app = hyper(nodeParserWithContext);
// Thanks to nodeParserWithContext every component now receives context!
const Component = (props, children, context) => <div />;
app(state, actions, view, document.body);
```
Want to see it in action?  Check out this [CodePen](https://codepen.io/jason-whitted/pen/BYVjmb).

### Example: Using Context to create Provider/connect (like redux)
Building upon the previous Context example, we can easily create a `Provider` component and `connect` HOC.

Want to see it in action?  Check out this [CodePen](https://codepen.io/jason-whitted/pen/LQrGam).

### Example: App supporting Connected Components
```jsx
const { h, hyper } from 'hyperapp';
// Create the app with a custom current parser
const app = hyper(nodeParserWithCurrent);
// Thanks to nodeParserWithCurrent every component now receives a current object
// The current object has getState() and getActions() methods
const Component = (props, children, { getState, getActions }) => <div />;
app(state, actions, view, document.body);
```

### Example: App that combines children into props
```jsx
const { h, hyper } from 'hyperapp';
// Create the app with a custom parser
const app = hyper(nodeParserWithChildrenInProps);
// Thanks to nodeParserWithChildrenInProps every component now only receives one props object
const Component = ({ children, ...other }) => <div>{children}</div>;
app(state, actions, view, document.body);
```

const app = hyper(nodeParserWithErrorBoundary);
// Thanks to nodeParserWithErrorBoundary components that throw errors can be handled

This PR also adds a `recycled` prop to the VNode to tell the updateElement that the old node was recycled. With this information, we are able to call `oncreate`, instead of `onupdate` on the first render.

### Please consider using a HOA (Higher Order App)

https://github.com/hyperapp/hyperapp/issues/533#issuecomment-355765388

Brief example of a HOA being used:

```js
const main = injectUpdate(app)(state, actions, view, document.body);

main.updateApp({
  newActions: {
    mult: () => ({ count }) => ({ count: count * 2 }),
  },
  newState: {
    count: 90,
  },
});

// OR

const main = injectUpdate(app)(state, actions, view, document.body);

import('./thing.js')
  .then(({ state: newState, actions: newActions }) => {
    main.updateApp({ newState, newActions });
  });
```

If we decide to delegate to a HOA, we should add a file in the docs `dynamic_loading.md` and explain the reason and point to the issue/PR etc..!",selfup,9837366

As in JavaScript arrays are objects with key as integer and a length property (and Array methods 🙄 ),
a lot of you/us tried to use the substate (slices) capablity along with arrays. Then ran in some troubles.

The merge functions are aware about objects but not about arrays, so it always return the object form 
of the array.
But in JavaScript we have a method `Array.from` to retrieve and array from it object form.

This fix can be done both in userland or in core, but adding it in core add another feature.

Lets talk first about the userland solution.

The only main trouble is when iterating through the array to copy it, the length property is not itterated. So, the resulting target does not contain this property and we cant match the array properties (key as integer + length property).

In other words, by saving the length property, we will be able to use our slices arrays like we are doing it with regular object by applying the `Array.from` method in the view.

Please take a look at this pen : https://codepen.io/Swizz540/pen/JMWLXB?editors=0011

But, As I said earlier, adding it in core (for the cost of **34 bytes**) add another feature, the ability to use array of substate/actions :tada:

```jsx
const state = {
  counts: [{
    count: 0
  }]
}

const actions = {
  counts: [{
    up: () => state => ({ count: state.count + 1 })
  }]
}

const view = (state, actions) => (
  <div>
   {state.counts[0].count}
  </div>
)

const main = app(state, actions, view, document.body)

main.counts[0].up()

## What changed?

This PR combines the concepts of state and actions into a single one, models.

A model is as if you literally merged current Hyperapp state and actions props into a single object. This change does not affect how slices work, so if you were wondering about that, now you know the answer!

How the app() function is called changed too. Instead of passing an object with named props, now you pass each prop as an argument like this:

```js
app(model, view)
```

or

```js
app(model, view, container)
```

Like before, if the view is undefined, nothing will be rendered. I found this order made the most logical sense.


## Examples
### Counter

```js
import { h, app } from ""hyperapp""

const model = {
  count: 0,
  down: () => model => ({ count: model.count - 1 }),
  up: () => model => ({ count: model.count + 1 })
}

const view = model => (
  <main>
    <h1>{model.count}</h1>
    <button onclick={model.down}>-</button>
    <button onclick={model.up}>+</button>
  </main>
)

app(model, view)
```

### Clock
```jsx
import { h, app } from ""hyperapp""

const angle = t => 2 * Math.PI * t / 60000

const model = {
  time: Date.now(),
  tick: () => ({
    time: Date.now()
  })
}

const view = model => (
  <svg viewBox=""0 0 100 100"" width=""200"">
    <circle cx=""50"" cy=""50"" r=""45"" fill=""blue"" />
    <line
      x1=""50""
      y1=""50""
      x2={50 + 40 * Math.cos(angle(model.time))}
      y2={50 + 40 * Math.sin(angle(model.time))}
      stroke=""white""
    />
  </svg>
)

const model = app(model, view)

setInterval(model.tick, 1000)
```

## Why? 

### Improve the nomenclature
Stores, models, modules, slices it's all the same. Models **organize** state and actions that belong together. They are not ""mixed"", as that simply suggests we are conflating things that should be apart. There is no violation of separation of concerns here. 

### Simplify sharing
#### Before
```js
// ABC.js
import { B } from ""./B""
import { C } from ""./C""

export const state = {
  value: 0,
  B: B.state,
  C: C.state
}
export const actions = {
  add: value => state => ({ value: state.value + value }),
  B: B.actions,
  C: C.actions
}
```
#### After
```js
// ABC.js
import { B } from ""./B""
import { C } from ""./C""

export const model = {
  value: 0,
  add: value => state => ({ value: state.value + value }),
  B, 
  C
}
```

### Simplify slices
Because the action tree must mimic the state tree in order for slices to work, you need to duplicate the same structure twice for every namespace in the state/actions tree. You also need to keep this in mind at all times. 

### Simplify wiring setup
#### Before
```js
import  { A } from ""./A""
import  { B } from ""./B""
import  { C } from ""./C""

app({
  state: {
    A: A.state,
    B: B.state,
    C: C.state
  },
  actions: {
    A: A.actions,
    B: B.actions,
    C: C.actions
  }
})
```

#### After
```js
import  { A } from ""./A""
import  { B } from ""./B""
import  { C } from ""./C""

app({ A, B, C })
```

### Simplify passing props to components
#### Before

```jsx
const view = state => actions => (
  <App>
    <Feed state={state.feed} actions={actions.feed} />
    <Trend state={state.trend} actions={actions.trend} />
  </App>
)

// OR

const view = state => actions => (
  <App>
    <Feed
      model={{
        ...state.feed,
        ...actions.feed
      }}
    />
    <Trend
      model={{
        ...state.trend,
        ...actions.trend
      }}
    />
  </App>
)

// OR

import { h, app } from ""hyperapp""
import { location, Route, Link } from ""@hyperapp/router""
import { auth } from ""./simple-auth""

const otherState = { ... }
const otherActions = { ... }

const actions = app({
  state: {
    ...otherState,
    auth: auth.state,
    location: location.state
  },
  actions: {
    ...otherActions,
    location: location.actions,
    auth: auth.actions
  },
  view: state => actions => (
    <AuthExample
      location={{
        go: actions.location.go,
        previous: state.location.previous
      }}
      login={actions.auth.login}
      userId={state.auth.userId}
      isLoggedIn={state.auth.userId !== null}
    />
  )
})

const unsubscribe = location.subscribe(actions.location)
```

#### After
```jsx
const view = model => (
  <App>
    <Feed model={model.feed} />
    <Trend model={model.trend} />
  </App>
)

//  OR

import { h, app } from ""hyperapp""
import { location, Route, Link } from ""@hyperapp/router""
import { auth } from ""./simple-auth""

const otherModel = { ... }

const model = app(
  {
    ...otherModel,
    auth,
    location
  },
  model => (
    <AuthExample
      location={model.location}
      auth={model.auth}
      isLoggedIn={model.auth.userId !== null}
    />
  )
)

const unsubscribe = location.subscribe(model.location)
```

### Add actions dynamically

No example, but this basically means the ability to add new actions on runtime and pave the way for code splitting #439.

### Other

- Easier refactoring
- Less bugs because of typos
- This change encourages you to setup your model and view separately in a variable and then pass it to the app. This makes it easier envision how to import/export your model and view properly. 🎉 

## Cons

- When creating a model from [localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage), you need to deep merge it with the original model source (because the actions are removed from the object when it is persisted).

Another proposal wanting to add ease about the use of actions. Async ones.

You all know, when thunk disappeared, it do not let us without any way to perform
async actions needing the most up to date state.  
This is because we were still, since a while, able to call sync actions from our
async actions.

Lets use a basic fetch action that fetch an array of users an add it to the current
users array.

```js
actions: {
  addUsers: state => users => ({ users: state.users.concat(users) })
  fetchNewUsers: (state, actions) => 
    fetch(""/newusers"")
      .then(res => res.json())
      .then(data => actions.addUser(data.users))
}
```

So as I said, we need two actions to perform this operation, the effects that
make the fetch and the reducer to update the state.

The proposition as you will do with function, is to allow you to write action in place : anonymous actions
So, you will dont have to write the `addUsers` function.

Mh. Yes, you will have to do this but only the implementation.

```js
actions: {
  fetchNewUsers: (state, actions) => 
    fetch(""/newusers"")
      .then(res => res.json())
      .then(data => state => ({ users: state.users.concat(data.users) }))
}
```

If you did not catch it, the anonymous action is right here :

```js
data => state => ({ users: state.users.concat(data.users) })
```

This one is exacly the same as the previous `addUsers` but anonymously.

Except one thing, the data position, because here you deal with the Promise resolving
data, exacly like you did with ... (the data live in the closure)

```js
.then(data => actions.addUser(data.users))
```

This PR include one more feature, a way to update with a constant partial (partials that dont need state).

**Why ?**

Anonymous actions allow you to catch the most up do date state, that is why they exist
and why you earlier use another action as reducer.

But sometime, you will just want to use the Promise resloving data as partial.

Actual :
```js
actions: {
  setUser: () => (user) => ({ user: user }),
  fetchUser: (state, actions) => 
    fetch(""/user"")
      .then(res => res.json())
      .then(user => actions.setUser(user)) // or .then(actions.setUser)
}
```

With anonymous actions :
```js
actions: {
  fetchUser: (state, actions) => 
    fetch(""/user"")
      .then(res => res.json())
      .then(user => ({ user: user }))
}
```
Following my implementation, you will notice one thing, as we consider anonymous 
actions as regular actions, constant actions also exist in the named world.

So, this will add as side effect another way to deal with

```js
actions: {
  reset: () => ({ counter: 0 })
}
```

By simply giving a constant partial 
```js
actions: {
  reset: ({ counter: 0 })
}

It would be very important to note here that the responsive classes works the _opposite way_ grid does. The case here, is a button to be expanded in smaller screens and normal in larger. So for example `pure-button-sm-expanded` has `@media screen and (max-width: 35.5em)` media query, which implements the behaviour described above.

A good candidate to do so is `grep()`, where it's currently returning a [multiline string](https://github.com/arturadib/shelljs/blob/master/src/grep.js#L46) while it could be better to return an array (with `inspect()` method) instead as `ls()` does.

Allows better generation of JSON/YAML asset manifests, by exposing each entry and it's outputs (including split chunks).

I'm not 100% sure how it would impact hooks. I can see there's one hook - the `beforeAssetTagGeneration` one - that would process the `assets` object I added the `entries` to. I guess in most cases if the plugin either mutates or does a clone and mutation, things will be fine. I can see if a hook generated it's own it would then be missing - but I don't think this is a major issue as it could be said the set of plugins in use does not support the new feature yet.

Worth noting when I reviewed this area of code, the injection code refers to the outer scope's `assets` and therefore `assets.manifest` from that outer scope, instead of the `assets` object floating through the Promise that a plugin may have replaced if it treated it as immutable. I can raise another PR to tweak but I guess means carrying through the `assets` a few stages further in the promise waterfall, as it quickly drops off and only passes through `assetTags` prior to the injection promise.",driskell,939815

In doing so, it should resolve #1158 and #1092. My hope is that using `toJson({all: false, chunkGroups: true})` with a filter for only the info we need is enough to mitigate the performance concerns that caused it to be removed previously. I benchmarked our build (6000 modules, 27 `HtmlWebpackPlugin` instances) and saw no change in duration with this change.

My use case for this is rendering `preload` tags, grouped by chunk, into the HTML template of our single page app. Each chunk's preload tags are inside of a conditional block that gets included in the final HTML rendered by the server only if that chunk is used by the initial route. Doing this allows us to start downloading route-specific chunks immediately before the main chunk has been dowloaded and parsed.

Our template that we feed into HtmlWebpackPlugin looks like this:
```handlebars
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
		<meta charset=""utf-8""/>
		<title>Test</title>

		<if isTrue=""{! route='one'}"">
			{{#each htmlWebpackPlugin.files.chunks.one.css as |file|}}
			<link rel=""preload"" href=""{{file}}"" as=""style"" />

<h3>JIT engine in core (<a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/3905"">#3905</a>)</h3>
<p>The <a href=""https://blog.tailwindcss.com/just-in-time-the-next-generation-of-tailwind-css"">brand-new JIT engine we announced in March</a> has now been merged into core, and is available as an opt-in feature using a new <code>mode</code> option in your <code>tailwind.config.js</code> file:</p>
<pre lang=""js""><code>// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  mode: 'jit',
  purge: [
    // ...
  ],
  // ...
}
</code></pre>
<p><strong>This feature is still in preview</strong> which means some details may change as we iron out the kinks, and it's not subject to semantic versioning.</p>
<p>If you were using <code>@tailwindcss/jit</code> before, you can now migrate to Tailwind CSS v2.1 instead, as that's where all new development on the engine will happen.</p>

541312953,Added Border Radius Feature,729,7471383,shipshapecode/shepherd,['wontfix'],closed,5,2019-12-21T10:46:22Z,2020-01-28T18:07:06Z,2020-01-28T18:07:06Z,"The Shepherd Library has helped the product we are developing in a whole new way. having said that we faced some issues on highlighting elements during the step navigations. The issue was we were not able to give a rounded borders to the highlighted elements and no convincing methods were found in the docs or issues whatsoever.

The PR contains the ability to pass `borderRadius` as a parameter in options of the step to add rounded corners with customized radius. Please go ahead and review the PR. Would be happy to solve any doubts or changes if required.

Things completed for this feature includes,
* Added `borderRadius` as an optional parameter in `step.d.ts` / `step.js`.
* Added the entry in wiki for `02-usage.md`.
* Modified SVG building to support `borderRadius` and necessary code changes to accept `borderRadius` just like `modalOverlayOpeningPadding` feature in `shepherd-model.svelte`.
* Modified Unit Tests to support borderRadius and added a new test for the same feature.

## Reason

* Existing code cannot accept arbitrary arguments in mathjax initialization. (Editor.initMath())
* With this fix, users using viewer.min.js can define custom initializers.
* Also, users will be able to handle use cases where they don't want to
use Mathjax.

## Background

* I used draw.io's viewer.min.js on my web page.

Upgrade dependencies to the newest version

use `peerDependenciesMeta`, instead of the non-standard `optionalPeerDependencies`.

move optional dependencies from `dependencies`

**Why:**
Keeping `next-auth` up-to-date, fixing bugs, reducing bundle size

**Changes:**
This pull request makes changes in the `SlashCommandBuilder` and `ContextMenuBuilder` to make sure they return properties in `camelCase` as the rest of the `discord.js` library does. To ensure no conflicts with the API, functions were already implemented to transform the properties before creating the commands with the API. See [ApplicationCommandManager](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js/blob/8b70f497a1207e30edebdecd12b926c981c13d28/packages/discord.js/src/managers/ApplicationCommandManager.js#L233-L262) & [ApplicationCommand](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js/blob/8b70f497a1207e30edebdecd12b926c981c13d28/packages/discord.js/src/structures/ApplicationCommand.js#L549-L587)
**Reason:**
This makes is possible to compare the data from the Builders with the data from the [ApplicationCommandManager.fetch()](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/discord.js/main/class/ApplicationCommandManager?scrollTo=fetch) method, which returns a [ApplicationCommand](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/discord.js/main/class/ApplicationCommand) or a collection of those with `camelCase` properties

**See also:**
For further information see #9083 

Follow up from #9084 
_I made sure to only edit properties which are not accessed by the API, as I didn't use search&replace this time_

- Husky creates a .gitignore file that ignores all the scripts in `.husky/_`

- Anyone using custom scripts (like `common.sh` [recommended in the docs](https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/?id=yarn-on-windows)) has to copy them manually

Desired behavior:

- Husky doesn't create a .gitignore file at all
- Husky reduces maintainability instead of increasing it
- The docs for every project using husky don't have to be updated to say ""Please run `npm run prepare` if you ever make a new git branch... or clone the git repo without npm install... or ever want to use husky""",DoctorDerek,761231

Only after you focus the inner content you can scroll it.
This can be prevented by adding this css to ``kitchen-sink/core/css/app.css``:
```css

By adding a z-index to the behind popup smaller than the one of the backdrop, we make the backdrop visible.

This solution has two issues:
1/ There is no ""animation"" when the backdrop of the stacked popup appears
2/ Since all the popups are using the same backdrop element, it's better to have all popups behaving the same (= all or none popup should have a backdrop, and all or none popup should have a click-to-close backdrop)

A better solution would be to generate a dedicated backdrop for each popup, with a z-index dynamically computed to be correctly sandwiched between the popups (or by having all the same z-index bu by being inserted in the right order). But it means a lot of recode in comparison to this one-line solution.

Either you or a supporter signed this repo up for Open Collective. This pull request adds backers and sponsors from your Open Collective https://opencollective.com/framework7 ❤️
  
  It adds two badges at the top to show the latest number of backers and sponsors. It also adds placeholders so that the avatar/logo of new backers/sponsors can automatically be shown without having to update your README.md. [[more info](https://github.com/opencollective/opencollective/wiki/Github-banner)]. See how it looks on [this repo](https://github.com/apex/apex#backers).
We have also added a `postinstall` script to let people know after `npm|yarn install` that you are welcoming donations (optional). [[More info](https://github.com/OpenCollective/opencollective-cli)]
You can also add a ""Donate"" button to your website and automatically show your backers and sponsors there with our widgets. Have a look here: https://opencollective.com/widgets

  P.S: As with any pull request, feel free to comment or suggest changes. The only thing ""required"" are the placeholders on the README because we believe it's important to acknowledge the people in your community that are contributing (financially or with code!).

Sometimes it may be preferable to define these methods in external js files, or in routes.js, so html file only left with template and style.

A work-around is to define the function methods in context, but they do not bind to component instance.

Propose to update componentLoader to merge the methods defined in routes.js with those defined in html file.

So routes could be like this:

`routes: [
{
path : '/path/,
componentUrl: '/pah/to/component/htmlfile',
on: {
},
methods: {
'method1: function
}
}

The basic idea is to replace component data (the viewmodel, actually) with a proxy on component creation, and catch all changes in proxy's set. Upon real viewmodel changes the new component html is created (using template7 and the current viewmodel data) and the dom is patched to the new state with morphdom. Finally all event handlers are reattached, etc.
The implementation is far from being complete, however things basically seem to work.

936021613,feat(external_api): Control participant pane to show or hide using custom button based on #9490,9491,7564420,jitsi/jitsi-meet,['wontfix'],closed,4,2021-07-02T19:27:23Z,2022-02-09T18:04:11Z,2022-02-09T18:04:11Z,"The issue with the External API was that there was no way to customize toggling of the participant pane. Here I have tested and fixed the problem by just creating an event for this job whose listener was already present.
Assume we have a button on Jitsi meet frontend that opens up a participant list on our web application. Pressing on the button should emit the event ‘show-participant-list’ and the web application listening to the event will open the participant list.

Here is how I edited the External API to achieve this functionality:

1. add key value to JSON of events _external_api.js_

`'show-participant-list': 'showParticipantList',`

2. Implement notify function on _api.js_

```
notifyShowParticipantList(enabled: boolean) {
        this._sendEvent({
            name: 'show-participant-list',
            enabled
        });

This PR is part of the Hackathon ""Winning over the classroom with Jitsi"". In one of the messages in Slack, participants were encouraged to submit PRs so that their project has more visibility. That is the reason behind this PR. However, the code in this PR needs refactoring and the functionality is nor finished, that's why I don't want this PR to be accepted (yet). I'm going to keep working on the functionality after the Hackathon, and only then the merge will have sense.

Overview

Our proposal was to implement the Excalidraw whiteboard to encourage all the call participants (like students and teachers) on modify and edit the same drawing thanks to the created shared room. It is available from a new button that redirects to the Excalidraw room

UI

It was added a new button on the Toolbox called ""Go to Whiteboard""

Current limitations and future work

Now all the participants in the same room can edit the drawing. In future release we can propose to use Excalidraw whiteboard without its main site's link",DavideCoppola,27409510

**Issue** 
It's important to save a chat history for any meeting because in the chat we are sharing some important notes, contact details, links, etc, and sometimes people end the meeting without saving those things into their personal notes.

Currently: when the user leaves the meeting they will lose all the messages
**Expect: user should have the option to download the chat history.**

**Solution**
**Automatically save the messages before leaving a meeting.**

Hi there Jitsi team!  This is a pretty massive PR for a new feature that allows users to share essentially any HTTPS URL while in a Jitsi meeting.  This is a feature that teachers have asked me for in the past, so hopefully the wider Jitsi audience finds it relevant.

I know this isn't complete yet, as you'll notice that toggling the 'Share a URL' button doesn't currently remove the shared document.  However, I should have a follow up PR with that fix in place in the near future.  I just wanted to make sure my entry for the hackathon was complete, and that I didn't miss the deadline because I was trying to get this feature perfected.  Hopefully it's useful!

Also, you can let me know if you don't like the sharedURL naming convention... it's always tricky when naming things with acronyms embedded in them.  Any other feedback would be appreciated as well - I'm positive I made some other glaring errors here.

- Labels and switch / button states across the board (welcome page, settings view, toolbar, menus)
- Deactivated overlay areas, making dialogs accessible
- Screen reader detection for extra features: close buttons on all bottom sheets, toolbar is always visible

Future work:

- Maybe disable all receiving video (set last N to 0) when a screen reader is detected?
- Improve accessibility of ParticipantView
- Improve accessibility of recentslist items
- Improve accessibility of warning / audio only / recording labels

In looking for alternative conference tools, Jitsi is at the top of the list, but one of the key features that prevents it from becoming the chosen solution is the lack of a ""green screen"" effect.

In an effort to fast track this much needed feature, I went ahead and made a rough introduction.

React and your environment in general are pretty foreign to me, so I'm sure there are some things you would've done differently. Please don't hesitate to point them out.

That said, I used the blur effect as a starting point, including the beta tag, and went from there. Overall, it works pretty well.

One of the key differences is that I noticed the blur effect introduces a potential leak in regards to the web worker. When you disable the effect, the worker persists. Granted, if you re-enable it, the same worker is consumed, but when it is disabled and never reactivated, the worker persists. Looking into the functionality of the worker, it seemed pretty strange. It looks like a manual FPS-esque/animation timer, so I removed that concept and switched to using `requestAnimationFrame`. I'm unsure of the original development conversation and the reasons these decisions were made, but I believe the blur effect should switch to this method as well and will open a separate PR if desired.

This PR introduces the ""green screen"" effect in a few different ways. There is the typical chroma key effect, then two implementations of the `bodyPix` library, MobileNet and ResNet.

Most parameters are configurable in a new ""Green Screen"" settings tab, including the color via a color picker widget for the chroma key effect, the chroma key threshold, all the various `bodyPix` parameters via dropdowns and range sliders, and the ultimate rendering FPS. Making these configuration options available was an effort to give users with lower tiered computers the ability to use the functionality.

Testing has been pretty minimal. I've used my 5 year old desktop, 10 year old laptop, 3 year old android and ios phones. Without too much resource usage, all were able to use at least the Chroma Key and MobileNet settings, with only the desktop being able to use the ResNet setting.

Possible additions/changes:
- Support (short?) video clips as a green screen
- More configuration (segmentationThreshold, maxDetections)
- Automatically restart the effect when enabled and settings have changed
- Preview of rendered green screen effect instead of just the selected image in the settings tab
- Different euclidean distance equation for the chroma key effect

 - moves the `<form>` element such that it encompasses the submit button, which doesn't need a click handler anymore since it will trigger the form submit event

To test for this, deploy using the produced source files (https://download.jitsi.org/jitsi-meet/src) and load the page from a browser on a non-english locale:

My change simply copies the needed files from the node_modules folder to the final source folder.

Related question - would it be okay to also ship the `doc` folder(160K uncompressed) in the source build?

It would ease distro packaging from the source binaries, as currently one needs to pull the source + docs from git.",C0rn3j,1641362
627178730,Skip global shortcut handling when meta key is pressed,6907,7564420,jitsi/jitsi-meet,['wontfix'],closed,5,2020-05-29T10:49:55Z,2020-12-12T20:36:09Z,2020-12-12T20:36:09Z,"I keep triggering all kinds of unwanted things when controlling my window manager while Jitsi Meet is focussed. For example, to split windows, I press Windows key + D. Now when a Jitsi Meet window is in focus at the same time, the screen share dialog pops up, disrupting my call.

This patch should skip shortcut actions when the Windows key is held (Windows key = `metaKey` in web browsers, apparently). Note that I didn't actually test it, yet, because I didn't find the time to figure out how to build and run the project from source. However, I feel pretty confident that it is correct, so before I end up never submitting it, I just went ahead without testing. Hope you still find it useful.

Feel free to extend this to other modifier keys, of course - I just went with the least invasive possible patch to scratch my specific itch ;-)",DerGuteMoritz,19733

The value used as the column maximum is already configurable via the `interface_config.js` by `TILE_VIEW_MAX_COLUMNS`. But this lines of code no just implement the default of '5' (which may be also refactored to a constant); the returned value is also clamped not to exceed this value.

603212285,Add support for building snaps & Ubuntu Core appliance image,6224,7564420,jitsi/jitsi-meet,"['wontfix', 'packaging']",closed,3,2020-04-20T12:48:43Z,2020-09-05T15:11:29Z,2020-09-05T15:11:29Z,"Hi folks,

Filing this PR here (as per Saul's instructions) rather than Jitsi repo.

======

Following up an email exchange with Emil, I'm filing this PR to request support for snaps, as a first step toward creating a Jitsi Ubuntu Core appliance.

This PR consists of:

* snapcraft.yaml that is used to build the snap using the snapcraft command-line tool (https://snapcraft.io/docs/snapcraft-overview).
* jitsi-videobridge.sh and jicofo.sh wrapper scripts (bash) that set the environment for the service to run (extrapolated from the systemd service).

The layout is:

* snap/snapcraft.yaml
* scripts/[jitsi-videobridge, jicofo].sh

I built Jitsi by using existing deb files as sources and then extracting them into the snap, and adding the necessary runtime requirements, like java, prosody, lua, etc. You can of course build from sources. I did this as it was a faster way to create a proof of concept for you guys to work with.

The next steps would be for you to build and test the snap of your own. You can build the snap using snapcraft locally, using our remote build feature that builds in launchpad, or use our online Build Services that can hook up GitHub repositories. The last two options also allow you to build for six architectures, which can be quite useful for building Jitsi for IoT devices, Pis, etc.

https://snapcraft.io/blog/handy-snapcraft-features-remote-build
https://snapcraft.io/build

Once you're comfortable with the syntax, you can then push the snap to the Snap Store.

This would entail three steps - registering a dev account, registering the Jitsi snap name, and then pushing the application to the store.

https://snapcraft.io/docs/releasing-to-the-snap-store

We can help you promote Jitsi, and then we can work on seeding the snap into the Ubuntu Core appliance image.

Let me know if you have any questions.",igorljubuncic,43789966

```javascript
export function isAnalyticsEnabled(stateful: Function | Object) {
    const { disableThirdPartyRequests, analytics = {} } = toState(stateful)['features/base/config'];

    return !(disableThirdPartyRequests || !analytics.googleAnalyticsTrackingId);
}
```

This solves issue #6179, beacause in this way function `createHandlers` in `react/features/analytics/functions.js` returns an empty array and do not try to create handlers (that would lead to an error):

```javascript
export function createHandlers({ getState }: { getState: Function }) {
    getJitsiMeetGlobalNS().analyticsHandlers = [];
    window.analyticsHandlers = []; // Legacy support.

    if (!isAnalyticsEnabled(getState)) {
        return Promise.resolve([]);
    }

    const state = getState();

The fragment itself seems to be of little value to an end user dev:

- The view is harder to access as in the demo Activity the current fragment has to be checked if it is an instance of the JitsiMeetFragment (a code smell unto its self) then multiple code paths need to exist to handle the possibility of null.

- The nature of inheritance means I am forced as a dev to use the JitsiMeetFragment as the base class, which in turn uses Android X's own Fragment (not necessarily a bad thing). This does cause problems however when an existing project has its own base fragment class.

- The lifecycle callbacks can be handled safely within the activity with no risk of the method getActivity() being null as they will be called from the activity itself.

- The Activity's `getJitsiView()` is brittle as from the Activity's point of view it does not have any guarantees that the Fragment returned is going to be the casted type, which could lead to a Cast related exception. Unlikely in the current setup admittedly but could easily be missed in future code changes.

- While it is fine the Fragment handles `onActivityResult()` I debate the value of having the static method called from there as the Activity will be called first then the Fragment. Before I made any changes it already handled this.

- Without `setRetainInstance(true)` set on the Fragment `onDestroy` should always occur after `onDestroyView()` the changes in the PR reflect this by calling JitsiView's `dispose()` method in the Activity's `onDestroy()`. A potentially better change is that given the current paradigm - Android View's have an overridable method called `onDetachedFromWindow()`, which would be called around `onDestroy()`, which means we *could* move the `dispose()` method internal to `Jitsiview` and abstract it completely.

- Minor point but the layout file is now simpler as the FrameLayout is unnecessary and has been removed. This should produce a negligible performance boost with redraws. ",grahamsmith,1571527

The unescapeHtml() was updated to _accept_ unsafe strings because some local variables are passed partially or completely unescaped to some methods (like in the contact list and chat messages). 

If a string contains a < or >, it is assumed to be at its final state. 
The character & cannot be added to the check because it may or may not be part of an entity.
The characters ' and "" are not added to the check because they are locally stored like ' and "", but they are received like &-apos; and &-quot;. Unescaping them again is not harmful.
(To test single and double quotes, try: **alert(window.localStorage.getItem('displayname'))** for the names **a**, **a'**, and **a&** in meet.jit.si. Check also how your name is shown to others)

The last commit is about escaping a string before editing it. Change your name to a&b for example and try editing by clicking on your user's thumbnail. It changes to **a&-amp;b**.

In the example for `ErrorBoundaryWithRetry` if `getDerivedStateFromError` resets the `fetchKey` in each error, then the `fetchKey` will not change every time you retry, and therefore relay is not triggering the fetch else just returning the same `error` probably in cache. While if we just reset the error `return {error};` we can see the fetch working in the network all the time.

Another fix are the TS typings, by default and without any extra anotation we are able to return `Partial<State>` ... that makes more sense for the case mentioned above, but also for the other examples in this file.

// Type definitions for React 16.9

type GetDerivedStateFromError<P, S> =. (error: any) => Partial<S> | null;

with this PR I added:
 * a unique id to the environment
 * the function dispose to the environment in order to clear the cache of requests associated with the environment
 * deleteQueryResourceForEnvironment in QueryResource in order to delete the query resources associated with the environment from the cache
 * deleteFragmentResourceForEnvironment in FragmentResource in order to delete the fragment resources associated with the environment from the cache
 * useEffect in RelayModernProvider in order to dispose the environment and delete resources when the environment is changed

In this way it is possible to have:
  * a control over the management of the resources used in relay
  * eliminate the need to use weakmap
  * use the id in the useEffect instead of the object
  * evaluate the creation of a public function `getPromiseForAllRequest `in `fetchQueryInternal` in order to be able to use this information during the SSR (you can easily make a first render, perform the await of all promises and perform a new render)

Finally, I made the following changes to the tests:
  * replaced the use of ReactRelayContext in favor of RelayEnvironmentProvider
  * moved the creation of alternative environments to the beginning of the test as the jest resetModule reset the RelayModernEnvironment index and environments with the same identifier were generated",morrys,2670647

This is primarily done to enhance exceptions that get monitored in tooling like Sentry. To enhance the stack traces with ""which query"", ""what variables"" and so on. Stitching in that world around the `transactionID` is hard as their transaction pattern would involve having a single context that a ""transaction"" would flow in see https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/performance/capturing/manual/.

This I believe is a more general approach as the information is there, may as well pass it on.

Approximately two year ago I've given a talk about Relay trying to share how beautifully smart and powerful Relay actually is.

Back in the day I kinda' struggled with the learning resources and the documentation of Relay, but I felt it has a great deal to offer. So I embarked in a journey trying to learn it inside-out by implementing it in real-life production apps. I learned much just by experimenting, exploiting the DevTools, digging through code and thoroughly reading the documentation over and over again.

This was my attempt of putting Relay in the spotlight by sharing everything that I've learned!

https://github.com/facebook/relay/issues/2829

its example of how this configuration can be used is given by the library is [wora/cache-persist](https://morrys.github.io/wora/docs/cache-persist.html) used in [react-relay-offline](https://github.com/morrys/react-relay-offline) to manage persistence and offline capabilities.

In short, `wora/cache-persist` is an object that allows you to manage interfacing with storage (localStorage, sessionStorage, indexedDB, AsyncStorage & any custom storage) in ""synchronous"" mode and with the possibility of serializing and deserialization of keys and values ​​in storage (used to filter keys, encription, compression ...)

This result is achieved by combining:
 * the initial **restore** of data persisted in an inmemory object (this is asynchronous, so either you perform the await on restore or perform the reconciliation between the initial state and the persistent state)
 * after restore, **data is read and written synchronously in the inmemory object** (optimizes performance)
 * each mutation of the object in memory is inserted in a **queue** managed asynchronously (the storage update interval is configurable, throttle default 500ms)
 * at the end of the interval a **merge** of the mutations is made in order to avoid repeated writing
 * the writes are grouped and the **multiSet** function of the storage is invoked (better performance if this function is natively implemented as for asyncstorage)
 * removals are grouped and the storage **multiRemove** function is invoked (better performance if this function is natively implemented as for asyncstorage)",morrys,2670647

1. People can now visually explore the collection and play with each function online (example: https://bit.dev/lodash/lodash/is-match)
2. They can install each function as a package with NPM and Yarn (I know you already did that by refactoring, publishing each package etc)
3. People can use Bit to develop each component right from their own project and best fit it to their needs.

I think to use ```isUndefined()``` and ```isNull()``` is better for making this code more readable since not only the naming of the functions are very clear, also they have been with ```lodash``` from the very beginning.

729d1a57aa77a9c82c8292dcfa0054e4b90060b1, based on issue #2758.

But the previous implementation was correct, which respected the
properties of the algebra.

The symmetric difference of two sets is the union of both of their
relative complements, and it is commutative:

`A Δ B = (A ∖ B) ∪ (B ∖ A)`

`A Δ B = B Δ A`

In that respect, both implementations were equivalents, the problem
appeared when you tired to xor multiple sets, since the new
implementation didn't respect the associative property:

`A Δ (B Δ C) = (A Δ B) Δ C`

```javascript
const a = [1, 2, 4, 5]
const b = [2, 3, 5, 6]
const c = [4, 5, 6, 7]

_.xor( _.xor(a, b), c )
// [1, 3, 5, 7] (correct)

_.xor( a, _.xor(b, c) )
// [1, 3, 5, 7] (correct)

_.xor( a, b, c )
// [1, 3, 7] (wrong)
```

With this fix, the associativity is respected:

```javascript
_.xor( a, b, c )
// [1, 3, 5, 7] (correct)

```

I have often needed to partition a collection of things based on whether two elements in the collection belong to the same group. Say, for instance, you have a collection of things that are linked to each other one-by-one, so A is connected to C, C is connected to E and B is connected to D. I would like a function that, given A, B, C, D and E, returns two groups: one containing A, C and E and one containing B and D.

In other words, it would be very cool if there were like a ‘families’ function accepting two parameters:
- a collection, and
- a predicate of two parameters which, if it returns true, means that those two elements belong to the same group.

Note: Given the state of flux of the repo, I was unable to run any scripts or tests, except for some local tests. There are also not any tests here, since they don't seem to be in this repo? Please advise.

Eventually I determined that the issue boils down to a fundamental incompatibility between the expectations for `debounce` and the expectations for `throttle`. Following the trailing edge, `debounce` does not (and should not) care about the the amount of time elapsed before the next leading edge. `throttle` does. There seem to be three possible approaches to resolving this:

1. Decouple the `throttle` and `debounce` implementations again. No thanks.
1. Reclaim `maxWait` in the name of House Throttle. In the original debounce-based throttle implementation, setting `maxWait` reset the `lastCall` time to the time that the trailing edge created by `maxWait` was invoked (see [here](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/commit/1933a766310997518ab09f591cf364bd71d30607#diff-001d0647fb00f8336795faccdec19a31R4885). This is ostensibly not correct, which is probably why the behavior was changed at some point.
1. Add a new option that `throttle` can utilize. This is the approach I went with.

I added an option called `cooldown` which lets you specify the minimum amount of time that must elapse between a trailing edge and a leading edge. Calls to `debounced` that occur in that interval are deferred until the end of that cooldown period (effectively creating a new trailing edge).

I often find myself using this mixin to test if collections consist of the same members:

``` javascript
_.consists([1,1,2,3], [3,1,2,1]);
// => true

_.consists([1,1,2,3], [3,1,2]);
// => false

_.consists('hello', ['o','l','l','e','h'], { a:'l', b:'h', c:'e', d:'o', e:'l' });
// => true
```

The common use case is to simply test if two arrays are equivalent ignoring order.  I've yet to find a terse way accomplish this using any combination of existing methods like `_.difference`, `_.intersection`, or `_.union` while handling:
- collections with duplicate values
- collections with non-primitive values

A couple more examples:

``` javascript
var a = { a: 'a' };
var b = { b: 'b' };
var b2 = { b: 'b' };

_.consists([a, b, b], [b, a, b]);
// => true

_.consists([a, b, b], [a, b, b2]);
// => false

Negative indices are a common pattern that make it easy for developers to get the last, 2nd-last, value in an array.

The way the implementation was added, it'd have far reaching implications.

``` js
_.result(['a','b','c'], -3) //=> 'a'
_.get(['a','b','c'], -2) //=> 'b'
_.at(['a','b','c'], -1) //=> ['c']
```

It's also possible to support a path push notation where `a[-0]` could indicate the array location after the last location. This was brought up by #1315.

``` js

I've had an idea to improve `zipObject` function. My English level is very low, sorry, but I can show and example of my idea.

``` js
[ ['test', 1], ['test', 2], ['test4': 3] ] => // before returns {test: 2, test4: 3}

I think would be useful that when a prop array is repeated, the result return a property with an array values.

``` js
[ ['test', 1], ['test', 2], ['test4': 3] ] => // now returns {test: [1,2], test4: 3}
```

With this commit, I've modified code to work this.

From the [underscore source code](https://github.com/jashkenas/underscore/blob/master/underscore.js#L1534-L1544):

```
  // AMD registration happens at the end for compatibility with AMD loaders
  // that may not enforce next-turn semantics on modules. Even though general
  // practice for AMD registration is to be anonymous, underscore registers
  // as a named module because, like jQuery, it is a base library that is
  // popular enough to be bundled in a third party lib, but not be part of
  // an AMD load request. Those cases could generate an error when an
  // anonymous define() is called outside of a loader request.
  if (typeof define === 'function' && define.amd) {
    define('underscore', [], function() {
      return _;
    });
  }
```

From the [lodash source code](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/blob/master/lodash.js#L11782-L11787):

```
  // Some AMD build optimizers like r.js check for condition patterns like the following:
  if (typeof define == 'function' && typeof define.amd == 'object' && define.amd) {
    // Expose lodash to the global object when an AMD loader is present to avoid
    // errors in cases where lodash is loaded by a script tag and not intended
    // as an AMD module. See http://requirejs.org/docs/errors.html#mismatch for
    // more details.
    root._ = _;

    // Define as an anonymous module so, through path mapping, it can be
    // referenced as the ""underscore"" module.

47518062,Adding support for `where` style callbacks in _.pick,764,7819469,lodash/lodash,"['enhancement', 'wontfix']",closed,5,2014-11-01T21:42:26Z,2018-12-27T18:56:29Z,2014-11-01T22:17:16Z,"I often find that I want to pick items from an object-collection (hashmap), which contain specific properties.
_.where would work except that it returns an array, and then I lose the key (hash) from the key:value pairs I was comparing.

For example (this is the test I added):

```
var collection = {
        'obj1': {'a': 1, 'b': 2},
        'obj2': {'a': 5, 'b': 2, 'c': 3},
        'obj3': {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3},
        'obj4': {'a': 1, 'b': 4, 'c': 3}
      };

      deepEqual(_.pick(collection, {'a': 1}), _.pick(collection, ['obj1', 'obj3', 'obj4']));
      deepEqual(_.pick(collection, {'a': 1, 'c': 3}), _.pick(collection, ['obj3', 'obj4']));
```

This is aligned with the rest of the lodash API for collections, which usually support the _.where style callback. 
I find that it is also useful when chaining, in conjunction with other functions which work on object-collections, and supports better composability. 

For example, with mapValues:

```
_(linksData)
  .pick({dataType: 'AnchorLink'})
  .mapValues(function(obj){
 return doSomething(obj);
}).value();
//returns mapped values of only 'AnchorLink' type.
```

What do you think?

The above results in the the first iteration of the callback to be called with index 0 and the result as undefined, instead of index 1 and `1` as the result value. I just did a strict check for `accumulator === undefined` which makes this change ""broader"" than my particular edge case, but it could also easily be `arguments.length < 3 || (arguments.length === 4 && accumulator === undefined)` if you want to still allow a specific case where you can intentionally set the accumulator to `undefined`. 

I realize this is sort of a toss up on which edge case makes the most sense, though right before 3.0.0 makes it a good time to alter this if it made sense.

passing in any additional specified arguments to the function, and then returns
the value of whatever was returned from the called function. This is useful as a
semantic wrapper for IIFE's and/or mocking out asynchronous task-based functions
in tests, such as `setTimeout`.
#### Some background

On the Refinery29 mobile web team we like to stub out `setTimeout` in some of our tests and simply have it call the function given to it. We find that this reduces test complexity when the code under question is not dependent on that asynchronous behavior, and it also speeds up our suite by quite a lot. The way we usually go about this is by doing something like 

``` javascript
spyOn(window, 'setTimeout').and.callFake(function(fn) { fn(); });
```

But this looks ugly and get cumbersome to type. We wanted to be able to pass in a higher-order function that could be used as a default ""call whatever your first argument is if it's callable"" behavior (in the same way that `_.identity` provides a convenient iterator), and couldn't find a library function in lodash that did this. So rather than write it ourselves and have it never see the light of day, I thought that it could be a useful addition to lodash's utility function.

``` javascript
spyOn(window, 'setTimeout').and.callFake(_.iife);
```

Beyond just providing the utility described above, `_.iife` could also possibly be used in the classic IIFE way

``` javascript
_.iife(function(global) {
  // your module here
}, this);
```

To provide a more semantic indication of an IIFE than just `(function() { ... })();` which - while canonical - could stand to be more denotative of what it's actually doing. This is why I made the function be able to accept arguments.

Thank you very much for creating and maintaining lodash! It's an awesome library that we all love using.

See: https://github.com/fastify/fastify/pull/2506

This commit removes the `context` property from `Request` and replaces it with a `Symbol` to both revert this breaking change, and to remove the `context` property from the API surface area.

This is potentially a breaking change, however, the `Request#context` property has never been documented, and is - based on my understanding of the intent in #2506 - not meant to be a part of the public API.

Not complete yet. I want to add a standalone typescript test file that tests the logger types I've defined. I think using the atomic approach to types declarations and testing will be the best way of improving type support across the project. 

In this PR I have declared the types for the `fastify` instance `logger` option parameter. It was previously defined as `any`. I am not sure if this is considered breaking or not because:
- Non TS devs will not witness any change
- TS devs who were incorrectly defining logging options were not following the JS API.

Furthermore on that second bullet, I'd like to update the logging documentation to be more explicit about what options users have for logging
1. Boolean, defaults to pino with no special configuration
2. Pass an object with Pino options
3. Pass an object that implements a 'valid logger'

a 'valid logger' could be better documented as the current line (in reference to custom serializers)
> This option will be ignored by any logger other than Pino.
Is not entirely true because a correctly implemented custom logger (with all of the level methods) and a set of valid serializers will generated into a valid logger by the `createLogger` method.

Address https://github.com/fastify/fastify/issues/1444

Currently `initialConfig` exposes an object that can have those properties:
```js
{
  http2, // show http2: true/false if explicitly passed.
  https, // show https: true or https: { allowHTTP1: true/false } if explicitly passed.
  ignoreTrailingSlash, // show ignoreTrailingSlash: true/false if explicitly passed.
  maxParamLength,
  bodyLimit,
  onProtoPoisoning,
  logger, // show logger: 'custom' if an instance is passed or logger: false/ { level }
  serverFactory, // show serverFactory: true if detected
  caseSensitive,
  requestIdHeader,
  genReqId, // show genReqId: 'custom' if a function is passed
  trustProxy, // show trustProxy: 'custom' if a function is passed
  pluginTimeout,
  querystringParser // show querystringParser: 'custom' if a function is passed
}
```
I have chosen to display a `custom` string when a custom function is explicitly passed to certain properties. And to avoid any security breach I filtered critical information (such as certificates, for example), i tried to avoid shallow freeze, so `initialConfig` is completely frozen and read-only.

Maybe some properties exposed here are not relevant and should to be removed, but for this first draft I tried to include all user customable options.

What do you think about this approach ?  If you have suggestions I am completely open, and when we reach a consensus I will write the documentation and a fastify 1.x backport too ^^

Removing not necessary pagination from apps.
Related to AECO-361 ->more than 50 slash commands, the commands after the 50 won't appear.  When installing the next app with slash commands, the current action is fetching from a paginated endpoint and is not asking for items after the first page.

<!-- CHANGELOG -->
Previously in server.tests.ts file there error messages showing because certain packages were not installed. These packages were jest and mocha for typescript, they were installed already for normal javascript but not typescript. I did npm i --save-dev @types/jest and npm i --save-dev @types/mocha and that got rid of the majority of the errors in that file.

This is what the error messages was showing previously:

This is the first automated pull requests to help reach the goal of up to date and stable software.
It updates all of the dependencies in the `package.json` in one go, but from now on you’ll receive **pull requests** for each dependency update **in isolation and in real time**.

For updates that satisfy the existing version range you’ll get pull-requests only if it breaks your build.

Example:

``` diff
-  ""underscore"": ""^1.6.0""
+  ""underscore"": ""^1.7.0""
```

When an update does not satisfy the existing range you’ll get the pull request right away.

Example:

``` diff
-  ""lodash"": ""^3.0.0""
+  ""lodash"": ""^4.0.0""
```

Happy fixing and merging :palm_tree:

- The `npm` command does not publish them to npmjs.com, so end users don't get benefit from them.
- We shouldn't attempt to lock dependencies using shrinkwrap anyways (increases the chance of duplicate dependencies in end user projects, which can cause issues, I can provide some links if curious). 
- The main reason to remove package-lock.json is because as we authors develop Docsify, we can catch in-range breaking changes to any dependencies and fix them before users receive the errors. Having package-lock.json otherwise prevents us from catching those bugs sooner. 
- We can manually pin dependencies as a last resort in package.json if we really need to.

**Summary**

Introduces two configuration options to control the behavior of the auto-scroll into a section view.

`scrollGap` adds an optional gap between the section where you want to scroll and the top-edge of the viewport. Useful for when having a fixed position navbar.
`scrollDuration` determines how long the scrolling animation should take (defaults to `500` which was the initial value). Setting to `0` will make the browser jump to the section right away.

**Summary**

Embedding file snippets via `/// [snippet]` is a very powerful feature, but it currently doesn't work well with markdown or HTML snippets.  I added a third option, `<!-- [snippet] -->`, to deal with this problem and modified the relevant docs.

I hate to make things difficult for the reviewers... but I got endless errors trying to build the project on my Windows machine, so I was not able to test or build the project.  I did test my regex additions separately though.  If someone could independently test this, it would be much appreciated.  Here's an example to make it easy:

```markdown
# Markdown file
Here is a snippet from another file:
[snippet](./another-markdown-file.md ':include :fragment=snippet')
```

```markdown
# Another markdown file
blah blah blah
<!-- [snippet] -->
This is a fragment from another markdown file
<!-- [snippet] -->
blah blah blah
```

This is something I wrote myself initially because I needed them for ep_webrtc tests.

The problem was caused when pad cookies were switched to a new system. Previously, there was no ""path="" for the pad prefs. Now we have `path=/` as well as `sameSite=Lax`. There's also an interesting nuance regarding setting the cookies before vs after the frame is loaded. Beforehand, it was only possible after it was loaded. Now, it's not only possible but necessary to do it before it's loaded. I go into details in a big comment to try to preserve some of the understanding in case this comes up again.

I also updated a couple tests in this PR to properly test these helper functions. None of the other tests in etherpad-lite use the pad settings. ep_webrtc tests make heavy use of them, however, and I've confirmed that this has improved things there. Do we know if any other plugins started using the pad prefs cookies in tests? (If so, the tests are probably broken at the moment)",orblivion,41976

Because the hooks are called in reverse order this means it must move to the upper most position.

With this in place, errorhandling is called on every `next(new Error('somethings forbidden').status = 403)` etc. Before it was only called when the route, in which the next handler is called with an error happens to have been registered before errorhandler (e.g. this was not the case for any static routes, caching_middleware etc).

Now it forwards all errors to express' internal error handler, while up to now it would convert any error that reaches the errorhandler to an 500. The error logging has been removed, as this is already the default with the internal error handler.

New is, that now any error is counted in the stats metrics.",webzwo0i,1636470

When ace.js is delivered, Minify.js parses ace.js and searches for `$$INCLUDE_CSS` strings and appends the content of those files to the end of ace.js. When the client loads & executes ace.js to build the iframes, it uses those CSS to create style/link tags.

That logic broke when custom skins where introduced some time ago. Also the advent of the workaround using version strings for cache busting prevents it from working. This PR fixes the code to parse the `$$INCLUDE_CSS` lines again, so that some HTTP requests are saved. atm only the `iframe_editor.css` file gets inlined, because it does not contain a version string. (Actually it's included twice, because there is no code to remove multiple inlines of the same file - that's also fixed in this PR.)

It's WIP because there are two issues:
1. `src/static/css/pad.css` and `src/static/skins/skinName/pad.css` are currently included in the outer and inner iframes + in pad.html for the parent document of those two iframes. Is this necessary? I ask because even after this PR there are two HTTP requests to those files from coming from pad.html. My solution would be to add code to ace.js that also adds CSS to the parent document.
2. For some reason I don't know yet, the paths for fonts are wrong now. (They should be something like `../../../static/font/...` but the requests go to `/font/...`. Would you agree, when I embed the fonts directly into CSS using Base64?

It probably only affects performance on first load, ",webzwo0i,1636470
696263043,WIP fix(settings): Reloading after removing settings keys,4273,8374631,ether/etherpad-lite,['wontfix'],closed,10,2020-09-08T23:49:15Z,2021-05-21T04:55:22Z,2021-05-21T04:55:22Z,"Addressing issue in #4217 

# The Problem

If you have a field in settings with a default value (hardcoded in `src/node/utils/Settings.js`), you can override it in a custom setting in `settings.json`. The settings admin (`/admin/settings`) lets you edit that custom setting, and click ""save"" and ""reload"" and it takes effect as expected. However if in the settings admin you _remove_ that setting, it doesn't go back to the default value; the value just stays the same. However if you do a hard restart of the server, the value does go back to the default.

# The Explanation

When you call `reloadSettings()` from the settings.json editor admin, it will take the your new settings and merge it, more or less, with the _currently loaded_ settings, not the _default_ settings. When you remove a key and reload within the settings admin, it overrides that now-missing key with the existing value, which is the custom value you had there before you removed it. If you do a hard reset, the previous custom value is flushed from memory, and it goes through the usual process of loading the default before loading any custom values.

This phenomenon happens at different levels of the `settings.json` object hierarchy, but I'm not sure if it happens at all of them, because of the merging method used. This may also depend on whether it's a plugin setting or not.

# The Proposed Fix

For my fix, I make a new function called `setDefaults()` which overwrites all of the settings with the defaults. I call it within `reloadSettings()` before `storeSettings(settings)` and `storeSettings(credentials)`. This also involves putting the defaults into its own easily identified object.

Assuming this is the desired path (per core developers' opinion(s)), I'll see if I can write some tests, and then clean up some confusing comments.",orblivion,41976

It uses **browserify** to bundle the static js modules, which also results in a slightly lower load time and less round trips to the server (from 39 to 30 requests in a plain Etherpad installation with no skin).

This branch is currently ~deployed on https://beta.etherpad.org~.

What's working:
- pad editing
- chat
- the skin system

What's still not working:
- plugins (they do not load because there is no CommonJS loader in the browser now)
- the timeslider (easy to solve)
- the js bundle must be generated maually running `cd src/static/js ; ./create-bundle.sh`


A definitive solution would be probably use different technologies, but this work demonstrates that it is achievable.
It would be interesting to see if some results can be incorporated in https://github.com/storytouch/ep_webpack/, or if something from that plugin can be upstreamed.
